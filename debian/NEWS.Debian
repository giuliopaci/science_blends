debian-science (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

 In former Debian releases todays Debian Pure Blends were called
 Custom Debian Distributions.  The related tools might have dropped
 some configuration files in /etc/cdd.  The only use were to control
 user menus stuff which was rarely used.  If you never changed any
 file in /etc/cdd/med you can ignore this.  If not please take over
 the changes to /etc/blends/med.
