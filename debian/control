Description: Debian Science Project config package
 This package provides the basic infrastructure of all science-* packages and is
 needed by them.
 .
 These are the science related metapackages in the Debian Science project:
 .
  * science-astronomy       packages related to astronomy

                            astronomical applications

 conveniently get most of scientific free software which is available in
 Debian.

Description: Debian Science Nanoscale Physics packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages related to
 Nanoscale Physics, which corresponds to the study of physical systems
 typically ranging from 1 to 100 nm in size. The properties of such
 systems usually depend on the number of atoms they are made of, while
 this number is still relatively large for an accurate description.
 .
 The nanoscale is the meeting point of classical and quantum physics.
 Previous research efforts were considering either smaller systems, for
 which everybody could develop their own methods and software
 independently, or much bigger systems, for which it was clearly
 impossible to provide a fine-grained description. Addressing the issues
 raised by the nanoscale requires however cooperative and coordinated
 efforts in a multidisciplinary context. This metapackage is part of
 such an endeavor.
 .
 Please note that packages listed as "recommended" may not be installed 
 by default, and that packages listed as "suggested" will not be
 installed unless the user asks for them to be installed.
