Description: Debian Science Nanoscale Physics packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages related to
 Nanoscale Physics, which corresponds to the study of physical systems
 typically ranging from 1 to 100 nm in size. The properties of such
 systems usually depend on the number of atoms they are made of, while

 .
 The nanoscale is the meeting point of classical and quantum physics.
 Previous research efforts were considering either smaller systems, for
 which everybody could develop their own methods and software
 independently, or much bigger systems, for which it was clearly
 impossible to provide a fine-grained description. Addressing the issues
 raised by the nanoscale requires however cooperative and coordinated
 efforts in a multidisciplinary context. This metapackage is part of
 such an endeavor.

Description: Debian Science packages for Psychophysics
 This metapackage will install Debian packages which might be useful for
 carrying out any experiment relating physical stimuli and their
 psychological effects.
 .
 The selection of packages is targeting software for stimuli delivery.
 For additional software related to the analysis of the acquired data
 refer to science-neuroscience-cognitive, med-imaging depending on the
 domain of application.  Additionally look into
 science-bci since those often provide a complete loop
 frameworks including stimuli delivery.
