Description: Debian Science Project config package
 This package provides the basic infrastructure of all science-* packages and is
 needed by them.
 .
 These are the science related metapackages in the Debian Science project:
 .
  * science-astronomy       packages related to astronomy
  * science-astronomy-dev   packages related to development of
                            astronomical applications
