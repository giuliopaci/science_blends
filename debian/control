Description: Debian Science Nanoscale Physics packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages related to
 Nanoscale Physics, which corresponds to the study of physical systems
 typically ranging from 1 to 100 nm in size. The properties of such
 systems usually depend on the number of atoms they are made of, while
 this number is still relatively large for an accurate description.
 .
 The nanoscale is the meeting point of classical and quantum physics.
 Previous research efforts were considering either smaller systems, for
 which everybody could develop their own methods and software
 independently, or much bigger systems, for which it was clearly
 impossible to provide a fine-grained description. Addressing the issues
 raised by the nanoscale requires however cooperative and coordinated
 efforts in a multidisciplinary context. This metapackage is part of
 such an endeavor.

Description: Debian Science Statistics packages
 This metapackage is part of the Debian Pure Blend "Debian Science"
 and installs packages related to statistics.  This task is a general
 task which might be useful for any scientific work.  It depends from
 a lot of R packages as well as from other tools which are useful to
 do statistics.  Moreover the Science Mathematics task is suggested
 to optionally install all mathematics related software.
