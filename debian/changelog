debian-science (0.2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * tasks/geography: removed hyphen from description
    Closes: #486929
  * tasks/astronomy:
    Moved gstar from Recommends to Ignore, because it seems to have
    vanished from Debian
  * tasks/*: s/Depends/Recommens/ - this is done by current cdd-dev anyway
    The rationale for this behaviour is explained there.  It seems logical
    to state in the tasks files what finally is implemented.  We might think
    about enabling real Depends later if there might be reasons for this.
