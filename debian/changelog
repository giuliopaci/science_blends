    - Increased dependency from Suggests to Depends for electric
      because it is not orphaned any more
  * tasks/physics:
    - lowercase prospective packages ESPResSo++ and PWscf
      Closes: #523077

  [ Alastair McKinstry ]
  * Added science-meteorology and science-meteorology-dev metapackages.
  * tasks/meteorology:

debian-science (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Andreas Tille ]
  * tasks/mathematics-dev: replace libs by lib-devels
    Closes: #515947
  * Vcs fields were fixed in previous version but closing the
    bug here which was reported later while the package was
    sitting in new
    Closes: #515943
  * science-mathematics: s/Depends: Isabelle/Depends: isabelle/
    Closes: #518048
  * Bumped policy to 3.8.1 and make use of the new feature that
    debian/control allows comment lines starting with # with no
    preceding whitespace. [Policy paragraph 5.2]
  * tasks/geography: Depend from proj-bin instead of proj
    Closes: #521819
  * Machine readable copyright file
  * Enhanced long desriptions for those tasks where lintian claimed
    about extended-description-is-probably-too-short

  [ Michael Hanke ]
  * Added preliminary task for cognitive neuroscience.

debian-science (0.4) experimental; urgency=low

  * Adapted Vcs fields to new location (cdd -> blends)
  * New metapackages: astronomy-dev, dataacquisition, engineering-dev,

debian-science (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * tasks/geography: removed hyphen from description
    Closes: #486929
  * tasks/astronomy: Added descriptions for packages that vanished from Debian
  * tasks/*: s/Depends/Recommens/ - this is done by current cdd-dev anyway
    The rationale for this behaviour is explained there.  It seems logical
    to state in the tasks files what finally is implemented.  We might think
    about enabling real Depends later if there might be reasons for this.
  * Current cdd-gen-control does not handle Recommends properly and thus
    all Recommends in tasks files were turned to Depends.
  * tasks/engineering: New task with some new dependencies and some
    moved from tasks/physics to this place
    Closes: #488962
