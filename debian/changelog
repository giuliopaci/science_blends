debian-science (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * tasks/geography: removed hyphen from description
    Closes: #486929
  * tasks/astronomy: Added descriptions for packages that vanished from Debian
  * tasks/*: s/Depends/Recommens/ - this is done by current cdd-dev anyway
    The rationale for this behaviour is explained there.  It seems logical
    to state in the tasks files what finally is implemented.  We might think
    about enabling real Depends later if there might be reasons for this.
  * Current cdd-gen-control does not handle Recommends properly and thus
    all Recommends in tasks files were turned to Depends.
  * tasks/engineering: New task with some new dependencies and some
    moved from tasks/physics to this place
    Closes: #488962
