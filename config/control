Description: Debian Science Project config package
 This package provides the basic infrastructure of all science-* packages and is
 needed by them.
 .
 These are the science related metapackages in the Debian Science project:
 .
  * science-astronomy       packages related to astronomy
  * science-astronomy-dev   packages related to development of
                            astronomical applications
  * science-biology         packages related to biology
  * science-chemistry       packages related to chemistry
  * science-dataacquisition packages related to data acquisition
  * science-electronics     packages related to electronics
  * science-engineering     packages related to engineering
  * science-engineering-dev packages related to development of
                            engineering applications
  * science-geography       packages related to geography
  * science-linguistics     packages related to linguistics
  * science-machine-learning  packages related to machine learning
  * science-mathematics     packages related to mathematics

  * science-meteorology     packages related to meteorology and climate
  * science-meteorology-dev packages related to the development of
                            meteorology and climate applications
  * science-neuroscience-cognitive   packages related to cognitive
                            neuroscience
  * science-physics         packages related to physics
  * science-robotics        packages related to robotics
 .
 This are metapackages for common utilities for all sciences:
 .
  * science-imageanalysis   packages related to image analysis
  * science-numericalcomputation   packages related to numerical
                            computation

  * science-typesetting     packages related to typesetting
  * science-viewing         packages related to viewing
 .
 Note: All these packages are so called metapackages. This means they are not
 executable programs, but only links to other packages. This way you will
 conveniently get most of scientific free software which is available in
 Debian.
