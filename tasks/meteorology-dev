Depends: libudunits-dev
WNPP: 532430

Why: widely used in climate models.
Pkg-Description: Library for the programatic handling of units of physical quantities
 The UDUNITS package supports units of physical quantities (e.g., meters, seconds).
 Specifically, it supports conversion between string and binary representations 
 of units, arithmetic manipulation of units, and conversion of numeric values between
 compatible units.

Depends: libdap-dev
Why: used by GrADS, NCL , etc. to retrieve netcdf and other large data files.

Depends: libnc-dap-dev

Pkg-Description: The netCDF Client Library is an alternative implementation of Unidata's netCDF 3.6 API.
 The netCDF Client Library is an alternative implementation of Unidata's   netCDF 3.6 API.
 Our version adds the capability to dereference OPeNDAP URLs. You can substitute our version 
 of the library when linking your application and then simply pass an OPeNDAP URL 
 in where you would normally use a file name.
