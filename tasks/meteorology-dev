Task: Meteorology-dev
Description: Debian Science Meteorology-dev packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages which might be
 helpful for development of applications for Meteorology and Climate.
 Please note that packages listed as "recommended" may not be installed by
 default, and that packages listed as "suggested" will not be
 installed unless the user asks for them to be installed.
 .
 You might also be interested in the science-meteorology metapackage.

Depends: libemos-dev

Depends: libgrib-api-dev, libgrib-api-tools
Why: grib-api is the standard library for GRIB2 file management.

Depends: libgrib2c-dev

Depends: libhe5-hdfeos-dev
Why: EOS extensions to the HDF library, for Earth Observation datatypes.

Depends: libhe4-hdfeos-dev
WNPP: 531558
Responsible: Alastair McKinstry <mckinstry@debian.org>
Why: EOS extensions to the HDF library, for Earth Observation datatypes.
Pkg-Description: Extension to HDF4 to support Earth Observing System datatypes
 HDF-EOS is a software library that is an extension of National Center 
 for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) HDF. The library supports the 
 construction of new data structures: Grid, Point and Swath.
 .
 This version is built against the HDF4

Depends: libproj-dev
Why: Needed for many cartographic tasks (eg coastlines on maps)

Depends: libgctp-dev

Depends: libnetcdf-dev, netcdf-bin

Depends: gfortran
Why: Much meteorological code is developed in Fortran.

Depends: ksh
Why: Many Meteorology codes use ksh as their scripting shells.

Depends: liblapack-dev, libblas-dev, libfftw3-dev
Why: Most forecasting codes use BLAS and LAPACK

Depends: libblas-doc, liblapack-doc, libfftw3-doc

Depends: pkg-config
Why: Simplifies the scripting of builds. 

Depends: libudunits-dev
WNPP: 532430
Responsible: Alastair McKinstry <mckinstry@debian.org>
Homepage: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/
Language: C
Why: widely used in climate models.
Pkg-Description: Library for the programatic handling of units of physical quantities
 The UDUNITS package supports units of physical quantities (e.g., meters, seconds).
 Specifically, it supports conversion between string and binary representations 
 of units, arithmetic manipulation of units, and conversion of numeric values between
 compatible units.

Depends: liboasis3-dev
WNPP: 531673
Homepage: http://www.prism.enes.org/PAEs/coupling_IO/software_OASIS3.php
Responsible: Alastair McKinstry <mckinstry@debian.org>
Why: Coupler used in many forecasting projects
 Many models link against OASIS even if they don't use it in a 
 given configuration, eg. the Harmonie model.
Pkg-Description: Coupler for exchanging fields between components of Earth system models
 OASIS3 is the direct evolution of the OASIS coupler developed since
 more than 10 years at CERFACS (Toulouse, France). Portability and
 flexibility are OASIS3 key design concepts. At run-time, OASIS3 acts as
 a separate mono process executable, which main function is to
 interpolate the coupling fields exchanged between the component models,
 and as a library linked to the component models, the OASIS3 PRISM Model
 Interface Library (OASIS3 PSMILe).
 .
 OASIS3 supports 2D coupling fields only. To communicate with OASIS3,
 directly with another model, or to perform I/O actions, a component
 model needs to include few specific PSMILe calls. OASIS3 PSMILe supports
 in particular parallel communication between a parallel component model
 and OASIS3 main process based on Message Passing Interface (MPI) and
 file I/O using the GFDL mpp_io library. 
 .
 OASIS3 has been extensively used in the PRISM demonstration runs and is
 currently used by approximately 15 climate modelling groups in Europe,
 USA, Canada, Australia, India and Brazil.

Depends: libdap-dev
Why: used by GrADS, NCL , etc. to retrieve netcdf and other large data files.

Depends: liblas-dev
WNPP: 532415

Pkg-Description: ASPRS LiDAR data translation toolset
 libLAS is a C/C++ library and toolset for reading and writing ASPRS
 LAS versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 data. The LAS format is a sequential
 binary format used to store data from sensors and as intermediate
 processing storage by some LiDAR-related applications.
 libLAS has C, C++, .NET, and Python APIs.

Depends: libnc-dap-dev
WNPP: 537111

Pkg-Description: The netCDF Client Library is an alternative implementation of Unidata's netCDF 3.6 API.
 The netCDF Client Library is an alternative implementation of Unidata's   netCDF 3.6 API.
 Our version adds the capability to dereference OPeNDAP URLs. You can substitute our version 
 of the library when linking your application and then simply pass an OPeNDAP URL 
 in where you would normally use a file name.
