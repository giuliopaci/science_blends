Task: Meteorology-dev
Description: Debian Science Meteorology-dev packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages which might be
 helpful for development of applications for Meteorology and Climate.
 .

Depends: libemos-dev
Why: standard library for BUFR formats

Depends: libgadap-dev

Depends: libcmor-dev
Pkg-Description: Development files for Climate Model Output Rewriter
 The "Climate Model Output Rewriter" (CMOR, pronounced "Seymour")
 comprises a set of C-based functions, with bindings to both python
 and FORTRAN 90, that can be used to produce CF-compliant netCDF files
 that fulfill the requirements of many of the climate community's
 standard model experiments. These experiments are collectively
 referred to as MIP's and include, for example, AMIP, CMIP, CFMIP,
 PMIP, APE, and IPCC scenario runs. The output resulting from CMOR
 is "self-describing" and facilitates analysis of results across models.

Depends: libgrib-api-dev, libgrib-api-tools
Why: grib-api is the standard library for GRIB2 file management.

Depends: libgrib2c-dev
Why: API for reading GRIB2 files

Depends: libhe5-hdfeos-dev
Why: EOS extensions to the HDF library, for Earth Observation datatypes.

Depends: libhe4-hdfeos-dev
Why: EOS extensions to the HDF library, for Earth Observation datatypes.

Depends: libproj-dev
Why: Needed for many cartographic tasks (eg coastlines on maps)

Depends: libgctp-dev

Depends: libnetcdf-dev, netcdf-bin

Depends: liblapack-dev, libblas-dev, libfftw3-dev

Depends: liblas-dev

Depends: libsphere-dev

Depends: libterralib-dev

Suggests: gfortran
Why: Much meteorological code is developed in Fortran.

Suggests: ksh
Why: Many Meteorology codes use ksh as their scripting shells.

Suggests: pkg-config
Why: Simplifies the scripting of builds. 

Depends: liboasis3-dev
Why: Coupler used by many climate models. Needed by some NWP models to compile.
 (or stubs for the same routines)
