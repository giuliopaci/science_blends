 The netCDF Client Library is an alternative implementation of Unidata's   netCDF 3.6 API.
 Our version adds the capability to dereference OPeNDAP URLs. You can substitute our version 
 of the library when linking your application and then simply pass an OPeNDAP URL 
 in where you would normally use a file name.
