Pkg-Description: manage a collection of botanical specimens
 Bauble is a software application to help you manage a collection of
 botanical specimens. It is intended to be used by botanic gardens, herbaria,
 arboreta, etc. to manage their collection information. It is a open, free,
 cross-platform alternative to BG-Base and similiar software. 
 .
 Features:
  * Bauble is designed to be simple, elegant and intuitive.
  * Bauble can use different database backends and is tested against SQLite and PostgreSQL.
  * Bauble can generate reports through an XSL formatter backend.
  * Bauble is transaction safe.
  * Bauble can export data in CSV or Access to Biological Collection Data (ABCD)
    format. In the future we hope to support other standard formats such as
    DarwinCore, ITF2, BioCASE, TAPIR, etc.
  * Bauble supports tagging. You can tag any arbitrary data stored in a Bauble
    managed database with arbitrary names.
