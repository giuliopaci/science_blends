Task: Biology
Description: Debian Science Biology packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages related to
 Biology.  You might also be interested in the field::biology debtag.
 .
 This metapackage makes use of the packages med-bio and med-bio-dev
 (for development of biological applications) which are maintained
 by Debian Med - another Debian Pure Blend.  If you are a biologist
 you are most probably interested in the Debian Med project which
 deals with biology and medicine in much more detail then the more
 general Debian Science.
