 debtag and, depending on your focus, in the education-mathematics
 metapackage.

X-Removed: Packages removed from Debian

Depends: octaviz
Pkg-URL: http://snapshot.debian.org/package/octaviz/
Homepage: http://octaviz.sourceforge.net/
Pkg-Description: 3D visualization system for Octave
 Octaviz is a visualization system for Octave. It is a wrapper that
 makes all VTK classes accessible from within Octave using the same
 object-oriented syntax as in C++ or Python. Octaviz also provides
 high-level functions for 2D and 3D visualization. Using those
 functions, most common visualization tasks (3D surface plots, contour
 plots etc) can be accomplished without any knowledge about VTK.
