 debtag and, depending on your focus, in the education-mathematics
 metapackage.

X-Removed: Packages removed from Debian

Depends: octaviz
Pkg-URL: http://snapshot.debian.org/package/octaviz/
Homepage: http://octaviz.sourceforge.net/
Pkg-Description: 3D visualization system for Octave
 Octaviz is a visualization system for Octave. It is a wrapper that
 makes all VTK classes accessible from within Octave using the same
 object-oriented syntax as in C++ or Python. Octaviz also provides
 high-level functions for 2D and 3D visualization. Using those
 functions, most common visualization tasks (3D surface plots, contour
 plots etc) can be accomplished without any knowledge about VTK.

Depends: sagemath
Pkg-URL: http://snapshot.debian.org/package/sagemath/
Homepage: http://sagemath.org/
Pkg-Description: Mathematics software written in Python
 Sage is a mathematical software package with support for a wide range
 of mathematics, including algebra, calculus, elementary to very
 advanced number theory, cryptography, numerical computation,
 commutative algebra, group theory, combinatorics, graph theory, and
 exact linear algebra.
 .
 Sage integrates several dozen mathematical software packages, making
 it possible to combine the best algorithms from several different
 packages together in a single Sage program.
 .
 Much of the Sage core and the Sage interfaces are implemented in
 Cython, helping Sage avoid the usual performance problems associated
 with Python.
 .
 Sage has a friendly command-line interface based on iPython and a
 web-based notebook interface which can run locally or connect to a
 remote Sage server over the network.

Depends: eprover
Pkg-URL: http://snapshot.debian.org/package/eprover/1.0.004-1/
Homepage: http://www.eprover.org/
Pkg-Description: Theorem prover for first-order logic with equality
 E is a fully automatic theorem prover for full first-order logic with
 equality. It accepts a mathematical specification and, optionally, a
 hypothesis, and tries to prove the hypothesis and/or find a
 saturation representing a (counter-)model for the specification.
 .
 E is based on a purely equational problem representation and
 implements a variant of the superposition calculus. Proof search can
 be guided with a multitude of options or a powerful automatic
 configuration mode. The system can process input in a number of
 different formats, including the standard TPTP-2 and TPTP-3
 formats. It can generate proof objects in PCL2 or TPTP-3/TSTP
 format.
 .
 E is considered one of the most powerful and friendly automated
 theorem provers for first-order logic. It has consistently been among
 the top system in the major categories of the CASC system competition,
 and usually been the strongest free software system.
