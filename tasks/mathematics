Pkg-Description: Generic theorem proving environment
 Features a choice of several ready-to-use logics (Higher Order Logic,
 Higher Order Logic augmented with Scott's Logic for Computable
 Functions, First Order Logic, Zermello-Frankel, an extensional
 version of Martin-Lof Type Theory, Barendregt's Lambda Cube, a few
 sequent calculi (including modal and linear logics), ...) or
 defining your own logic / deductive system, a procedural and a
 declarative proof style, rich automation for classical reasoning,
 equational logic and algebra, LaTeX and X-Symbols notational support.
 .
 Isabelle can also be used as a generic framework for rapid
 prototyping of deductive systems.

X-Removed: Packages removed from Debian

Depends: octaviz
Pkg-URL: http://snapshot.debian.org/package/octaviz/
Homepage: http://octaviz.sourceforge.net/
Pkg-Description: 3D visualization system for Octave
 Octaviz is a visualization system for Octave. It is a wrapper that
 makes all VTK classes accessible from within Octave using the same
 object-oriented syntax as in C++ or Python. Octaviz also provides
 high-level functions for 2D and 3D visualization. Using those
 functions, most common visualization tasks (3D surface plots, contour
 plots etc) can be accomplished without any knowledge about VTK.
Remark: Removed from Debian
 This package was removed from Debian but some versions are available
 from http://snapshot.debian.org/
 .

Depends: sagemath
Pkg-URL: http://snapshot.debian.org/package/sagemath/
Homepage: http://sagemath.org/
Pkg-Description: Mathematics software written in Python
 Sage is a mathematical software package with support for a wide range
 of mathematics, including algebra, calculus, elementary to very
 advanced number theory, cryptography, numerical computation,
 commutative algebra, group theory, combinatorics, graph theory, and
 exact linear algebra.
 .
 Sage integrates several dozen mathematical software packages, making
 it possible to combine the best algorithms from several different
 packages together in a single Sage program.
 .
 Much of the Sage core and the Sage interfaces are implemented in
 Cython, helping Sage avoid the usual performance problems associated
 with Python.
 .
 Sage has a friendly command-line interface based on iPython and a
 web-based notebook interface which can run locally or connect to a
 remote Sage server over the network.
