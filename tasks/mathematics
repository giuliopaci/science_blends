Pkg-Description: dynamic mathematics software for schools
 GeoGebra is a dynamic geometry system. You can do constructions with points,
 vectors, segments, lines, conic sections as well as functions and change
 them dynamically afterwards. On the other hand, equations and coordinates
 can be entered directly.

Pkg-Description: Generic theorem proving environment
 Features a choice of several ready-to-use logics (Higher Order Logic,
 Higher Order Logic augmented with Scott's Logic for Computable
 Functions, First Order Logic, Zermello-Frankel, an extensional
 version of Martin-Lof Type Theory, Barendregt's Lambda Cube, a few
 sequent calculi (including modal and linear logics), ...) or
 defining your own logic / deductive system, a procedural and a
 declarative proof style, rich automation for classical reasoning,
 equational logic and algebra, LaTeX and X-Symbols notational support.
 .
 Isabelle can also be used as a generic framework for rapid
 prototyping of deductive systems.
