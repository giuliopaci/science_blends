Pkg-Description: numerical optimization framework
 New numerical optimization framework developed by optimization department
 of cybernetics institute (Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences) in
 collaboration with SciPy developers team.  Primary goals:
  * providing connections to lots of solvers (some are C- or Fortran-written)
    with easy and unified OpenOpt syntax
  * trying to enhance algorithms for numerical optimization invented by
    ukrainian academicians Boris Pshenichniy and Naum Z. Shor
 .
 Free Python-based cross-platform alternative to commercial frameworks like
 AMPL, GAMS, TomOpt's TOMLAB/TOMNET.
