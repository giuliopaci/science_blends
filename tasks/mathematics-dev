Task: Mathematics-dev
Description: Debian Science Mathematics-dev packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages which might be helpful
 for development of applications for Mathematics. Please note that there are
 also recommended and only suggested packages which are not installed in any
 circumstances but only if the user asks for installing these.
 You might be interested as well in the science-mathematics metapackage.

Pkg-Description: Python module for numerical optimization
 Numerical optimization framework developed in Python which provides
 connections to lots of solvers with easy and unified OpenOpt
 syntax. Problems which can be tackled with OpenOpt
  * Linear Problem (LP)
  * Mixed-Integer Linear Problem (MILP)
  * Quadratic Problem (QP)
  * Non-Linear Problem (NLP)
  * Non-Smooth Problem (NSP)
  * Non-Linear Solve Problem (NLSP)
  * Least Squares Problem (LSP)
  * Linear Least Squares Problem (LLSP)
  * Mini-Max Problem (MMP)
  * Global Problem (GLP)
 .
 A variety of solvers is available (e.g. IPOPT, ALGENCAN).
