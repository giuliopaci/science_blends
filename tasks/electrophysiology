Suggests: relacs
Homepage: http://www.relacs.net
Language: C++
WNPP: 604564
License: GPL-2+
Pkg-Description: framework for closed-loop neurophysiological experiments
 RELACS is designed as an framework for closed-loop experiments that
 may considerably speed up this traditional approach and in addition
 offers novel experimental possibilities. In a closed-loop experiment
 a stimulus is presented, the resulting response is immediately
 analyzed, and properties of the next stimulus (e.g. mean
 intensity) are adjusted as needed.
 .
 RELACS comes with an extensive set of data-analysis functions. The
 functions are implemented in C++ to allow fast and memory efficient
 data-analysis as it is required for closed-loop experiments:
  - Basic statistics (e.g. mean, standard deviation)
  - Spectral analysis: power spectrum, transfer function, coherence
  - Linear and nonlinear fits (Levenberg-Marquardt and Simplex)
  - Peak detection
  - Histograms, interpolation
  - Stimulus generation: pulse, saw tooth, band-pass filtered white
    noise, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise
  - Firing rates: mean, binned, convolved with kernels (e.g. rectangle,
    triangle, Gaussian)
  - Interspike intervals: histogram, CV, serial correlation, etc.
  - Spike timing precision: vector strength, reliability, correlation,
    synchrony etc.
 .
 RELACS plugin infrastructure allows to adapt it to specific hardware
 drivers and they allow you to implement research protocols, filters,
 spike detectors, etc.

Pkg-Description: tools for recording from MEAs and RT processing
 Meabench is a set of interacting linux programs for recording data
 from MEAs and real time processing. It can be used to acquire and
 visualize data from MultiChannel Systems multi-electrode array
 hardware in real time. On-line spike detection is available, as well
 as suppression of artifacts induced by 60 Hz pickup and by
 stimulation. A growing number of small utilities for data analysis is
 included with the source code, and you can easily add your
 own. Meabench provides continuous and triggered recording of raw
 electrode data as well as extracted spike data. Meabench is very
 suitable for real-time feedback stimulation, since roundtrip times
 from pre-amplifier to stimulator is less than 200 ms worst-case (less
 than 50 ms average).
