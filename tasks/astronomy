Depends: xephem

License: Non-free
Responsible: Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pena <jfs@computer.org>
Pkg-URL: http://snapshot.debian.net/archive/2005/03/13/debian/pool/non-free/x/xephem/
Pkg-Description: An interactive astronomical ephemeris for X.
 Xephem is an interactive astronomical ephemeris program for X Windows
 systems with Motif.  It provides many graphical views as well as
 quantitative heliocentric, geocentric and topocentric information for
 Earth satellites, solar system and celestial objects.
 .
Remark: Removed from Debian due to licensing issues.

Ignore: gstar
Homepage: http://www.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/gstar/
License: GPL
Responsible: Maintainer: Muhammad Hussain Yusuf <muhammad_yusuf@lineone.net>
Pkg-URL: http://snapshot.debian.net/archive/2005/03/13/debian/pool/main/g/gstar/
Pkg-Description: a gtk front-end for the starchart program
 gstar is a gtk front-end for the "starchart" program (originally by Alan
 Paeth, updated in 1990 by Craig Counterman) which generates high-quality
 postscript charts of any chosen region of the sky. It also prints the current
 Julian date and gives positions of the planets.
Remark: Removed from Debian due to licensing issues.

Suggests: pdl, pgplot5, python-scientific
Why: Already in science-viewing

Depends: eso-midas

Depends: wxastrocapture

Depends: ssystem
Pkg-URL: http://snapshot.debian.org/package/ssystem/
Homepage: http://www1.las.es/~amil/ssystem
Pkg-Description: 3D solar system simulator
 An OpenGL Solar System simulator which includes the sun, the nine
 planets, a few major satellites, and background stars.
 .
 This package has since been rewritten and repackaged as Celestia,
 but since that package has significantly higher hardware requirements
 than ssystem does, this package is being kept around.  Celestia
 has a better looking solar system, more options, and unlike ssystem,
 is actually still being worked on, so you probably only want to use
 this if you have older hardware that cannot run Celestia at a
 reasonable speed.
Remark: Removed from Debian
 This package was removed from Debian but some versions are available
 from http://snapshot.debian.org/
 .
 Reasons are given here: http://bugs.debian.org/352709

Suggests: stars
Pkg-URL: http://snapshot.debian.org/package/stars/
Homepage: http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~wbrisken/src/
Pkg-Description: star map program that draws the night sky
 Stars is an astronomy program that lets you view the sky from
 your computer.
 .
 Except for generating a small rotation matrix and some parameters,
 all math is integer based, allowing very fast display. At 16 bytes
 of memory per object, many objects can be loaded at once. Most
 graphics are antialiased.

Depends: spacechart
Homepage: http://www.gnu.org/software/spacechart/
Pkg-URL: http://snapshot.debian.org/package/spacechart/
Pkg-Description: Star map viewer and navigator
 SpaceChart is a program to display 3d maps of stars and move freely
 around it. It is capable of showing only a subset of the stars in a
 given data file, and only those within a given distance of the center
 of the display. Also, it shows lines between stars that are closer than
 a given distance.
Remark: Removed from Debian
