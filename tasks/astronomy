Task: Astronomy
Description: Debian Science Astronomy packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages related to
 Astronomy.  You might also be interested in field::astronomy debtag
 and, depending on your focus, in the education-astronomy metapackage.

X-Comment: It is not really astronomy, do we need another category or
           should we put space flight related packages into this task?

Depends: xephem
Homepage: http://www.clearskyinstitute.com/xephem/
License: Non-free
Responsible: Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pena <jfs@computer.org>
Pkg-URL: http://snapshot.debian.net/archive/2005/03/13/debian/pool/non-free/x/xephem/
Pkg-Description: An interactive astronomical ephemeris for X.
 Xephem is an interactive astronomical ephemeris program for X Windows
 systems with Motif.  It provides many graphical views as well as
 quantitative heliocentric, geocentric and topocentric information for
 Earth satellites, solar system and celestial objects.

 This project used to be an official Debian package in 2002 but vanished
 from the Debian pool of packaged software (for reasons that should be
 clarified).  The URL of the "unofficial" package points to the location
 where the old package could be found on http://snapshot.debian.net.
 .
 There are later upstream versions than this Debian package available.

Ignore: gstar
Homepage: http://www.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/gstar/
License: GPL
Responsible: Maintainer: Muhammad Hussain Yusuf <muhammad_yusuf@lineone.net>
Pkg-URL: http://snapshot.debian.net/archive/2005/03/13/debian/pool/main/g/gstar/
Pkg-Description: a gtk front-end for the starchart program
 gstar is a gtk front-end for the "starchart" program (originally by Alan
 Paeth, updated in 1990 by Craig Counterman) which generates high-quality
 postscript charts of any chosen region of the sky. It also prints the current
 Julian date and gives positions of the planets.
 .
 This project used to be an official Debian package in 2002 but vanished
 from the Debian pool of packaged software - perhaps because it is outdated
 and only reasonable in combination with spacechart.  The URL of the
 "unofficial" package points to the location
 where the old package could be found on http://snapshot.debian.net.

Suggests: pdl, pgplot5, python-scientific, yorick
Why: Already in science-viewing

Depends: orbfit
Homepage: http://newton.dm.unipi.it/orbfit/
WNPP: 459154
License: GPL
Responsible: Steffen Moeller <steffen_moeller@gmx.de>
Pkg-Description: computation of asteroidal orbits
 OrbFit is a software system allowing one to compute the orbits
 of asteroids (soon also comets) starting from the observations,
 to propagate these orbits, and to compute predictions on the future
 (and past) position on the celestial sphere. It is a tool to be used
 to find a well known asteroid, to recover a lost one, to attribute a
 small group of observations, to identify two orbits with each other,
 to study the future (and/or past) close approaches to Earth, thus to
 assess the risk of an impact, and more.
 .
 OrbFit has been developed by a team of professional scientists, working
 in the field of asteroid and comet dynamics, orbit determination,
 nonlinear and chaotic dynamics, and astrometry. The composition of the
 OrbFit consortium, and the motivations for this work, are described
 below.
 .
 Status of packaging:
 .
 A rudimentary package was prepared, upstream was contacted with a very
 positive reply. The packaging bits will be injected to pkg-scicomp
 in near future.

Depends: linoccult
Homepage: http://linoccult.sourceforge.net/
WNPP: 459358
License: GPL
Responsible: Steffen Moeller <steffen_moeller@gmx.de>
Pkg-Description: predicts occultations of stars by minor planets
 LinOccult uses the DE405 precomputed major planets ephemeris (position
 of astronomical object in the sky at a given time) that are provided by
 the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for a precise numerical integration
 of asteroidal orbits. The user can select asteroids to process by
 changing several parameters in a configuration file.
 .
 Some initial packaging has been performed and will be submitted to
 pkg-scicomp.alioth.debian.org.

Depends: midas
Homepage: http://www.eso.org/sci/data-processing/software/esomidas/
WNPP: 412488
License: GPL
Responsible: Alastair McKinstry <mckinstry@debian.org>
Pkg-Description: the European Southern Observatory Munich Image Data Analysis System
 The ESO-MIDAS system provides general tools for image processing and
 data reduction with emphasis on astronomical applications including
 imaging and special reduction packages for ESO instrumentation at La
 Silla and the VLT at Paranal. In addition it contains applications
 packages for stellar and surface photometry, image sharpening and
 decomposition, statistics and various others.
 .
 The official name, ESO-MIDAS, is a registered trademark. ESO-MIDAS is
 available under the GNU General Public License (GPL), and can be
 implemented on OpenVMS and UNIX (Linux) systems.

Depends: fv
Homepage: ftp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/software/lheasoft/fv/
Pkg-URL: http://snapshot.debian.org/package/fv/
Pkg-Description: a tool for viewing and editing FITS format files
 Fv provides a graphical user interface to data stored in FITS
 (Flexible Image Transport System) files.  Local files can be created,
 viewed and edited, files on the internet can be opened read-only
 through the http and ftp protocols.  Through the POWplot program,
 FITS data can be visualized in a large variety of styles.  An
 interface to the SkyView online database allows for searching,
 downloading, and plotting of images and object lists for a region of
 the sky.
Remark: Removed from Debian
 This package was removed from Debian but some versions are available
 from http://snapshot.debian.org/

Depends: saods9

Depends: ssystem
Pkg-URL: http://snapshot.debian.org/package/ssystem/
Homepage: http://www1.las.es/~amil/ssystem
Pkg-Description: 3D solar system simulator
 An OpenGL Solar System simulator which includes the sun, the nine
 planets, a few major satellites, and background stars.
 .
 This package has since been rewritten and repackaged as Celestia,
 but since that package has significantly higher hardware requirements
 than ssystem does, this package is being kept around.  Celestia
 has a better looking solar system, more options, and unlike ssystem,
 is actually still being worked on, so you probably only want to use
 this if you have older hardware that cannot run Celestia at a
 reasonable speed.

Suggests: stars
Pkg-URL: http://snapshot.debian.org/package/stars/
Homepage: http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~wbrisken/src/
Pkg-Description: star map program that draws the night sky
 Stars is an astronomy program that lets you view the sky from
 your computer.
 .
 Except for generating a small rotation matrix and some parameters,
 all math is integer based, allowing very fast display. At 16 bytes
 of memory per object, many objects can be loaded at once. Most
 graphics are antialiased.

Depends: spacechart
Homepage: http://www.gnu.org/software/spacechart/
Pkg-URL: http://snapshot.debian.org/package/spacechart/
Pkg-Description: Star map viewer and navigator
 SpaceChart is a program to display 3d maps of stars and move freely
 around it. It is capable of showing only a subset of the stars in a
 given data file, and only those within a given distance of the center
 of the display. Also, it shows lines between stars that are closer than
 a given distance.
