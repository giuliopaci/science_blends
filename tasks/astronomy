Pkg-Description: computation of asteroidal orbits
 OrbFit is a software system allowing one to compute the orbits
 of asteroids (soon also comets) starting from the observations,
 to propagate these orbits, and to compute predictions on the future
 (and past) position on the celestial sphere. It is a tool to be used
 to find a well known asteroid, to recover a lost one, to attribute a
 small group of observations, to identify two orbits with each other,
 to study the future (and/or past) close approaches to Earth, thus to
 assess the risk of an impact, and more.
 .
 OrbFit has been developed by a team of professional scientists, working
 in the field of asteroid and comet dynamics, orbit determination,
 nonlinear and chaotic dynamics, and astrometry. The composition of the
 OrbFit consortium, and the motivations for this work, are described
 below.
 .
 Status of packaging:
 .
 A rudimentary package was prepared, upstream was contacted with a very
 positive reply. The packaging bits will be injected to pkg-scicomp
 in near future.

Pkg-Description: predicts occultations of stars by minor planets
 LinOccult uses the DE405 precomputed major planets ephemeris (position
 of astronomical object in the sky at a given time) that are provided by
 the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for a precise numerical integration
 of asteroidal orbits. The user can select asteroids to process by
 changing several parameters in a configuration file.
 .
 Some initial packaging has been performed and will be submitted to
 pkg-scicomp.alioth.debian.org.

Pkg-Description: the European Southern Observatory Munich Image Data Analysis System
 The ESO-MIDAS system provides general tools for image processing and 
 data reduction with emphasis on astronomical applications including 
 imaging and special reduction packages for ESO instrumentation at La 
 Silla and the VLT at Paranal. In addition it contains applications 
 packages for stellar and surface photometry, image sharpening and 
 decomposition, statistics and various others.
