Task: Astronomy
Description: Debian Science Astronomy packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages related to Astronomy.
 You might be interested as well in field::astronomy debtag and, depending on
 your focus, in education-astronomy metapackage.

Recommends: spacechart

License: GPL
Responsible: Francisco Garcia <franciscomanuel.garcia@hispalinux.es>
Pkg-URL: http://packages.debian.org/en/etch/spacechart
Pkg-Description: Star map viewer and navigator
 SpaceChart is a program to display 3d maps of stars and move freely
 around it. It is capable of showing only a subset of the stars in a
 given data file, and only those within a given distance of the center
 of the display. Also, it shows lines between stars that are closer than
 a given distance.

 This project used to be an official Debian in Etch but vanished later
 from the Debian pool of packaged software - for reasons that should be
 clarified.  One reason might be that the development of this softare
 is stalled since the beginning of 2002. The URL of the "unofficial"
 package points to the location of the package in Etch.

Pkg-URL: http://snapshot.debian.net/archive/2005/03/13/debian/pool/non-free/x/xephem/
Pkg-Description: An interactive astronomical ephemeris for X.
 Xephem is an interactive astronomical ephemeris program for X Windows
 systems with Motif.  It provides many graphical views as well as
 quantitative heliocentric, geocentric and topocentric information for
 Earth satellites, solar system and celestial objects.

 This project used to be an official Debian package in 2002 but vanished
 from the Debian pool of packaged software (for reasons that should be
 clarified).  The URL of the "unofficial" package points to the location
 where the old package could be found on http://snapshot.debian.net.

 There are later upstream versions than this Debian package available.

Pkg_URL: http://snapshot.debian.net/archive/2005/03/13/debian/pool/main/g/gstar/
Pkg-Description: a gtk front-end for the starchart program
 gstar is a gtk front-end for the "starchart" program (originally by Alan
 Paeth, updated in 1990 by Craig Counterman) which generates high-quality
 postscript charts of any chosen region of the sky. It also prints the current
 Julian date and gives positions of the planets.
 .
 This project used to be an official Debian package in 2002 but vanished
 from the Debian pool of packaged software - perhaps because it is outdated
 and only reasonable in combination with spacechart.  The URL of the
 "unofficial" package points to the location
 where the old package could be found on http://snapshot.debian.net.

Suggests: pdl, pgplot5, python-scientific, yorick
Why: Already in science-viewing

Pkg-Description: computation of asteroidal orbits
 OrbFit is a software system allowing one to compute the orbits
 of asteroids (soon also comets) starting from the observations,
 to propagate these orbits, and to compute predictions on the future
 (and past) position on the celestial sphere. It is a tool to be used
 to find a well known asteroid, to recover a lost one, to attribute a
 small group of observations, to identify two orbits with each other,
 to study the future (and/or past) close approaches to Earth, thus to
 assess the risk of an impact, and more.
 .
 OrbFit has been developed by a team of professional scientists, working
 in the field of asteroid and comet dynamics, orbit determination,
 nonlinear and chaotic dynamics, and astrometry. The composition of the
 OrbFit consortium, and the motivations for this work, are described
 below.
 .
 Status of packaging:
 .
 A rudimentary package was prepared, upstream was contacted with a very
 positive reply. The packaging bits will be injected to pkg-scicomp
 in near future.

Recommends: linoccult
Homepage: http://linoccult.sourceforge.net/
WNPP: 459358
License: GPL
Responsible: Steffen Moeller <steffen_moeller@gmx.de>
Pkg-Description: predicts occultations of stars by minor planets
 LinOccult uses the DE405 precomputed major planets ephemeris (position
 of astronomical object in the sky at a given time) that are provided by
 the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for a precise numerical integration
 of asteroidal orbits. The user can select asteroids to process by
 changing several parameters in a configuration file.
 .
 Some initial packaging has been performed and will be submitted to
 pkg-scicomp.alioth.debian.org.
