Pkg-Description: library for solving large sparse eigenproblems
 BLZPACK (for Block LancZos PACKage, release 04/00) is a standard Fortran 77
 implementation of the block Lanczos algorithm intended for the solution of the
 standard eigenvalue problem Ax=µx or the generalized eigenvalue problem
 Ax=µBx, where A and B are real, sparse symmetric matrices, µ an eigenvalue and
 x an eigenvector.
 .
 The development of this eigensolver was motivated by the need to solve large,
 sparse, generalized problems from free vibration analyses in structural
 engineering. Several upgrades were performed afterwards aiming at the solution
 of eigenvalues problems from a wider range of applications.
 .
 Documentation: user's guide, technical report and comprehensive bibliography.
 .
 Install this package if you need to compile or link against BLZPACK.

Pkg-Description: Geant4 Application for Emission Tomography
 GATE incorporates the Geant4 libraries in a modular, versatile, and
 scripted simulation toolkit which is adapted to the field of nuclear
 medicine both in PET (Positron Emission Tomography) and SPECT (Single
 Photon Emission Computer Tomography). It allows the accurate description
 of time-dependent phenomena such as source or detector movement and
 source decay kinetics. The ability to synchronize all time-dependent
 components allows a coherent description of the acquisition process. It
 makes it possible to perform realistic simulations of data acquisitions
 in time.

Depends: openfoam
License: GPL
Homepage: http://www.opencfd.co.uk/openfoam/
Pkg-Description: Computational fluid dynamics application
 The OpenFOAM (Open Field Operation and Manipulation) CFD Toolbox can
 simulate anything from complex fluid flows involving chemical
 reactions, turbulence and heat transfer, to solid dynamics,
 electromagnetics and the pricing of financial options.
Remark: will probably never enter Debian
 According to https://lists.debian.org/debian-science/2012/06/msg00049.html
 packaging would be really complex and it contains some non-free components.
 Freefoam (see above) is some kind of  plugin replacement.

Depends: jfreemesh
Homepage: http://dev.artenum.com/projects/JFreeMesh
License: QPL
Pkg-Description: 3D mesh library in Java
 JFreeMesh is a 3D mesh library written in Java and providing a high level API
 for mesh manipulation. JFreeMesh is based on a descending mesh data structure
 but simulate a full connectivity mesh by providing optimized method to access
 to any upper mesh element by using the global mesh methods. Therefore,
  JFreeMesh allows to load a large amount of mesh elements for a small memory
 foot print. JFreeMesh comes with a default mesh loader based on the GMSH file
 format and provides, through the JFreeMesh-VTK package, an exporter to VTK.

Pkg-Description: Extensible Simulation Package for Research on Soft matter
 ESPResSo is a highly versatile software package for the scientific
 simulation and analysis of coarse-grained atomistic or bead-spring
 models as they are used in soft matter research, with emphasis on
 charged systems.

X-Removed: Packages removed from Debian

Depends: octaviz
Pkg-URL: http://snapshot.debian.org/package/octaviz/
Homepage: http://octaviz.sourceforge.net/
Pkg-Description: 3D visualization system for Octave
 Octaviz is a visualization system for Octave. It is a wrapper that
 makes all VTK classes accessible from within Octave using the same
 object-oriented syntax as in C++ or Python. Octaviz also provides
 high-level functions for 2D and 3D visualization. Using those
 functions, most common visualization tasks (3D surface plots, contour
 plots etc) can be accomplished without any knowledge about VTK.
Remark: Removed from Debian
 This package was removed from Debian but some versions are available
 from http://snapshot.debian.org/
 .
 Reasons are given here: http://bugs.debian.org/535537

Depends: root-system

Depends: libroot-tmva-dev, libroot-montecarlo-vmc-dev, libroot-math-mlp-dev
X-Comment: Somebody injected the libraries from the ROOT system explicitely
 here for physics - so these are included since root-system is packaged again
X-Suggests: root-plugin-fftw3, libroot-mathmore5.18
 In case these packages will be created in root-system these need to be
 added here as well.
