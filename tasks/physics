Pkg-Description: Meta package to install all ROOT packages
 This package is a meta package to ensure the installation of all
 possible ROOT packages on this system. 
 .
 The ROOT system provides a set of OO frameworks with all the
 functionality needed to handle and analyse large amounts of data in a
 very efficient way. Having the data defined as a set of objects,
 specialised storage methods are used to get direct access to the
 separate attributes of the selected objects, without having to touch
 the bulk of the data. Included are histograming methods in 1, 2 and 3
 dimensions, curve fitting, function evaluation, minimisation,
 graphics and visualisation classes to allow the easy setup of an
 analysis system that can query and process the data interactively or
 in batch mode.
 .
 Thanks to the built-in CINT C++ interpreter, the command language, the
 scripting, or macro, language, and the programming language are all
 C++. The interpreter allows for fast prototyping of the macros since
 it removes the time consuming compile/link cycle. It also provides a
 good environment to learn C++. If more performance is needed, the
 interactively developed macros can be compiled using a C++ compiler.
 .
 The system has been designed in such a way that it can query its
 databases in parallel on MPP machines or on clusters of workstations
 or high-end PC's. ROOT is an open system that can be dynamically
 extended by linking external libraries. This makes ROOT a premier
 platform on which to build data acquisition, simulation and data
 analysis systems.
Why: suggested by Kevin B. McCarty, thanks to cdd-dev 0.4 will be turned into \
     a suggests as long as not available in unstable.

Pkg-Description: A Combinatorial/Constructive Solid Geometry, solid modeling system
 BRL-CAD is a powerful Combinatorial/Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG)
 solid modeling system that includes an interactive geometry editor,
 ray-tracing support for rendering and geometric analysis,
 network-distributed framebuffer support, image and signal-processing
 tools, and an embedded scripting language. It has been developed over
 a 20 year period and is now a stable mature product. This is the 
 first GPL'ed release of the package. It is being maintained by the
 US Army Research laboratory (ARL).

Pkg-Description: System for processing and editing triangular meshes
 MeshLab is an open source, portable, and extendible system for the
 processing and editing of unstructured 3D triangular meshes.
 The system is aimed to help the processing of the typical not-so-small
 unstructured models arising in 3D scanning, providing a set of tools for
 editing, cleaning, healing, inspecting, rendering and converting this kind
 of meshes.
 .
 Meshlab can read files in these formats: PLY, STL, OFF, OBJ, 3DS, COLLADA
 and PTX. It can write PLY, STL, OFF, OBJ, 3DS, COLLADA, VRML, and DXF.

Pkg-Description: Geant4 Application for Emission Tomography
 GATE incorporates the Geant4 libraries in a modular, versatile, and
 scripted simulation toolkit which is adapted to the field of nuclear
 medicine both in PET (Positron Emission Tomography) and SPECT (Single
 Photon Emission Computer Tomography). It allows the accurate description
 of time-dependent phenomena such as source or detector movement and
 source decay kinetics. The ability to synchronize all time-dependent
 components allows a coherent description of the acquisition process. It
 makes it possible to perform realistic simulations of data acquisitions
 in time.

Pkg-Description: Field-theory motivated computer algebra system
 Cadabra is a computer algebra system designed specifically for the
 solution of problems encountered in field theory. It has extensive
 functionality for tensor polynomial simplification including
 multi-term symmetries, fermions and anti-commuting variables,
 Clifford algebras and Fierz transformations, implicit coordinate
 dependence, multiple index types and many more. The input format is
 a subset of TeX.

Pkg-Description: library for solving large sparse eigenproblems
 BLZPACK (for Block LancZos PACKage, release 04/00) is a standard Fortran 77
 implementation of the block Lanczos algorithm intended for the solution of the
 standard eigenvalue problem Ax=µx or the generalized eigenvalue problem
 Ax=µBx, where A and B are real, sparse symmetric matrices, µ an eigenvalue and
 x an eigenvector.
 .
 The development of this eigensolver was motivated by the need to solve large,
 sparse, generalized problems from free vibration analyses in structural
 engineering. Several upgrades were performed afterwards aiming at the solution
 of eigenvalues problems from a wider range of applications.
 .
 Documentation: user's guide, technical report and comprehensive bibliography.
 .
 Install this package if you need to compile or link against BLZPACK.

WNPP: 428750
License: LGPL/Public Domain/GL2PS LICENSE
Responsible: Daniel Leidert <daniel.leidert@wgdd.de>
Pkg-Description: display crystal structures on ordinary computer hardware
 DRAWxtl reads a basic description of the crystal structure, which includes
 unit-cell parameters, space group, atomic coordinates, thermal parameters or
 a Fourier map, and outputs a geometry object that contains polyhedra, planes,
 lone-pair cones, spheres or ellipsoids, bonds, iso-surface Fourier contours
 and the unit-cell boundary.
 .
 Four forms of graphics are produced:
 .
  (1) an openGL window for immediate viewing
  (2) the Persistence of Vision Ray Tracer (POV-RAY) scene language for
      publication-quality drawings
  (3) the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) for dissemination
      across the Internet
  (4) a Postscript rendering of the OpenGL window for those that want
      high-quality output but do not have
      POV-RAY installed.

Pkg-Description: toolkit for simulation of particle/nuclear physics in detectors
 GEANT4 is a toolkit for the simulation of the passage of particles through
 matter.   Its application areas include high energy physics and nuclear
 experiments, medical, accelerator and space physics studies.  The GEANT4
 software consists of an extensive set of libraries, fundamentally
 object-oriented and based in modern C++.  It may be used to develop programs
 with command-line, Xaw-based, or Motif-based interfaces.
 .
 This package is a metapackage that depends upon all components of a
 GEANT4 environment.  Unless you know exactly what parts of GEANT4
 you want, it is best to install this package.

 The CLHEP project was proposed by Leif Lönnblad at CHEP 92. It is intended to
 be a set of HEP-specific foundation and utility classes such as random
 generators, physics vectors, geometry and linear algebra. CLHEP is structured
 in a set of packages independent of any external package (interdependencies
 within CLHEP are allowed under certain conditions).
