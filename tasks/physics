Pkg-Description: library for solving large sparse eigenproblems
 BLZPACK (for Block LancZos PACKage, release 04/00) is a standard Fortran 77
 implementation of the block Lanczos algorithm intended for the solution of the
 standard eigenvalue problem Ax=µx or the generalized eigenvalue problem
 Ax=µBx, where A and B are real, sparse symmetric matrices, µ an eigenvalue and
 x an eigenvector.
 .
 The development of this eigensolver was motivated by the need to solve large,
 sparse, generalized problems from free vibration analyses in structural
 engineering. Several upgrades were performed afterwards aiming at the solution
 of eigenvalues problems from a wider range of applications.
 .
 Documentation: user's guide, technical report and comprehensive bibliography.
 .
 Install this package if you need to compile or link against BLZPACK.

Pkg-Description: CLHEP - A Class Library for High Energy Physics
 The CLHEP project was proposed by Leif Lönnblad at CHEP 92. It is intended to
 be a set of HEP-specific foundation and utility classes such as random
 generators, physics vectors, geometry and linear algebra. CLHEP is structured
 in a set of packages independent of any external package (interdependencies
 within CLHEP are allowed under certain conditions).

WNPP: 428750
License: LGPL/Public Domain/GL2PS LICENSE
Responsible: Daniel Leidert <daniel.leidert@wgdd.de>
Pkg-Description: display crystal structures on ordinary computer hardware
 DRAWxtl reads a basic description of the crystal structure, which includes
 unit-cell parameters, space group, atomic coordinates, thermal parameters or
 a Fourier map, and outputs a geometry object that contains polyhedra, planes,
 lone-pair cones, spheres or ellipsoids, bonds, iso-surface Fourier contours
 and the unit-cell boundary.
 .
 Four forms of graphics are produced:
 .
  (1) an openGL window for immediate viewing
  (2) the Persistence of Vision Ray Tracer (POV-RAY) scene language for
      publication-quality drawings
  (3) the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) for dissemination
      across the Internet
  (4) a Postscript rendering of the OpenGL window for those that want
      high-quality output but do not have
      POV-RAY installed.

Pkg-Description: Geant4 Application for Emission Tomography
 GATE incorporates the Geant4 libraries in a modular, versatile, and
 scripted simulation toolkit which is adapted to the field of nuclear
 medicine both in PET (Positron Emission Tomography) and SPECT (Single
 Photon Emission Computer Tomography). It allows the accurate description
 of time-dependent phenomena such as source or detector movement and
 source decay kinetics. The ability to synchronize all time-dependent
 components allows a coherent description of the acquisition process. It
 makes it possible to perform realistic simulations of data acquisitions
 in time.

Pkg-Description: toolkit for simulation of particle/nuclear physics in detectors
 GEANT4 is a toolkit for the simulation of the passage of particles through
 matter.   Its application areas include high energy physics and nuclear
 experiments, medical, accelerator and space physics studies.  The GEANT4
 software consists of an extensive set of libraries, fundamentally
 object-oriented and based in modern C++.  It may be used to develop programs
 with command-line, Xaw-based, or Motif-based interfaces.
 .
 This package is a metapackage that depends upon all components of a
 GEANT4 environment.  Unless you know exactly what parts of GEANT4
 you want, it is best to install this package.
