Pkg-Description: library for solving large sparse eigenproblems
 BLZPACK (for Block LancZos PACKage, release 04/00) is a standard Fortran 77
 implementation of the block Lanczos algorithm intended for the solution of the
 standard eigenvalue problem Ax=µx or the generalized eigenvalue problem
 Ax=µBx, where A and B are real, sparse symmetric matrices, µ an eigenvalue and
 x an eigenvector.
 .
 The development of this eigensolver was motivated by the need to solve large,
 sparse, generalized problems from free vibration analyses in structural
 engineering. Several upgrades were performed afterwards aiming at the solution
 of eigenvalues problems from a wider range of applications.
 .
 Documentation: user's guide, technical report and comprehensive bibliography.
 .
 Install this package if you need to compile or link against BLZPACK.

Pkg-Description: CLHEP - A Class Library for High Energy Physics
 The CLHEP project was proposed by Leif Lönnblad at CHEP 92. It is intended to
 be a set of HEP-specific foundation and utility classes such as random
 generators, physics vectors, geometry and linear algebra. CLHEP is structured
 in a set of packages independent of any external package (interdependencies
 within CLHEP are allowed under certain conditions).

Pkg-Description: Geant4 Application for Emission Tomography
 GATE incorporates the Geant4 libraries in a modular, versatile, and
 scripted simulation toolkit which is adapted to the field of nuclear
 medicine both in PET (Positron Emission Tomography) and SPECT (Single
 Photon Emission Computer Tomography). It allows the accurate description
 of time-dependent phenomena such as source or detector movement and
 source decay kinetics. The ability to synchronize all time-dependent
 components allows a coherent description of the acquisition process. It
 makes it possible to perform realistic simulations of data acquisitions
 in time.

Pkg-Description: toolkit for simulation of particle/nuclear physics in detectors
 GEANT4 is a toolkit for the simulation of the passage of particles through
 matter.   Its application areas include high energy physics and nuclear
 experiments, medical, accelerator and space physics studies.  The GEANT4
 software consists of an extensive set of libraries, fundamentally
 object-oriented and based in modern C++.  It may be used to develop programs
 with command-line, Xaw-based, or Motif-based interfaces.
 .
 This package is a metapackage that depends upon all components of a
 GEANT4 environment.  Unless you know exactly what parts of GEANT4
 you want, it is best to install this package.

Pkg-Description: Computational fluid dynamics application
 The OpenFOAM (Open Field Operation and Manipulation) CFD Toolbox can
 simulate anything from complex fluid flows involving chemical
 reactions, turbulence and heat transfer, to solid dynamics,
 electromagnetics and the pricing of financial options.

Pkg-Description: 3D mesh library in Java
 JFreeMesh is a 3D mesh library written in Java and providing a high level API
 for mesh manipulation. JFreeMesh is based on a descending mesh data structure
 but simulate a full connectivity mesh by providing optimized method to access
 to any upper mesh element by using the global mesh methods. Therefore,
  JFreeMesh allows to load a large amount of mesh elements for a small memory
 foot print. JFreeMesh comes with a default mesh loader based on the GMSH file
 format and provides, through the JFreeMesh-VTK package, an exporter to VTK.

Pkg-Description: A virtual lens design workshop
 OpticalRayTracer is an application that analyzes systems of
 lenses. It uses optical principles and a virtual optical bench
 to predict the behavior of many kinds of ordinary and exotic lens
 types. OpticalRayTracer includes an advanced, easy-to-use interface
 that allows the user to rearrange the optical configuration by simply
 dragging lenses around using the mouse.
