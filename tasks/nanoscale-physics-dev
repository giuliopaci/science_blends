Task: Nanoscale Physics Development
Description: Debian Science Nanoscale Physics development packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages which might be
 helpful for the development of applications for Nanoscale Physics.
 .
 You might also be interested in the debtag field::physics and, depending
 on your focus, in the nanoscale-physics, physics and education-physics
 metapackages.

Pkg-Description: Maximally Localized Wannier Functions - Development files
 Wannier90 is an electronic-structure software computing
 maximally-localized Wannier functions (MLWF). It works on top of other
 electronic-structure software, such as Abinit, FLEUR, and PwSCF.
 .
 This package contains the development files needed to interface other
 software with Wannier90.

Pkg-Description: A Fortran library for XML
 FoX is an XML library written in Fortran 95. It allows software
 developers to read, write and modify XML documents from Fortran
 applications without the complications of dealing with multi-language
 development.
 .
 The developer is offered three principle APIs which are accessed as
 Fortran modules. FoX_wxml is an XML writer used to sequentially create
 arbitrary XML documents quickly with minimal memory requirements.
 FoX_sax is a streaming, validating parser based on java's Simple API
 for XML. The third module, FoX_dom, offers a full implementation of the
 W3C Document Object Model (DOM).

Pkg-Description: Non-Blocking MPI Collective Operations
 LibNBC is a prototypic implementation of a nonblocking interface for MPI
 collective operations. Based on ANSI C and MPI-1, it supports all MPI-1
 collective operations in a nonblocking manner.

Pkg-Description: Library to read and write pseudopotentials
 Pseudopotentials consist in atomic data used for atomic-scale electronic
 structure calculations. Libpspio is a library to read and write
 pseudopotentials in various formats, allowing as well for conversion in
 some cases.

WNPP: 602110
Pkg-Description: Library of DFT exchange-correlation functionals
 Libxc is a library of exchange-correlation functionals. The aim is to
 provide a portable, well tested and reliable set of exchange and
 correlation functionals that can be used by all the ETSF codes and also
 other codes.
 .
 In libxc you can find different types of functionals: LDA, GGA,
 hybrids, mGGA (experimental) and LCA (not working). This functionals
 depend on local information, in the sense that the value of the
 potential at a given point depends only on the values of the density -
 and the gradient of the density and the kinetic energy density, for the
 GGA and mGGA cases, or the vorticity for LCA - at a given point.
 .
 As of today, more than 100 functionals are available for various kinds
 of electronic-structure calculations.

Pkg-Description: Crystal symmetry finder library
 Spglib is a C-library written for finding crystal symmetry. Symmetry
 operations, space groups, ..., can be obtained using this symmetry
 finder.

Depends: root-system

Depends: libroot-tmva-dev, libroot-montecarlo-vmc-dev, libroot-math-mlp-dev
X-Comment: Somebody injected the libraries from the ROOT system explicitely
 here - so these are included since root-system is packaged again
X-Suggests: root-plugin-fftw3, libroot-mathmore5.18
 In case these packages will be created in root-system these need to be
 added here as well.
