Task: Nanoscale Physics Development
Description: Debian Science Nanoscale Physics development packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages which might be
 helpful for the development of applications for Nanoscale Physics.
 .
 You might also be interested in the debtag field::physics and, depending
 on your focus, in the nanoscale-physics, physics and education-physics
 metapackages.

Pkg-Description: Maximally Localized Wannier Functions - Development files
 Wannier90 is an electronic-structure software computing
 maximally-localized Wannier functions (MLWF). It works on top of other
 electronic-structure software, such as Abinit, FLEUR, and PwSCF.
 .
 This package contains the development files needed to interface other
 software with Wannier90.

Pkg-Description: Library to read and write pseudopotentials
 Pseudopotentials consist in atomic data used for atomic-scale electronic
 structure calculations. Libpspio is a library to read and write
 pseudopotentials in various formats, allowing as well for conversion in
 some cases.

Pkg-Description: Crystal symmetry finder library
 Spglib is a C-library written for finding crystal symmetry. Symmetry
 operations, space groups, ..., can be obtained using this symmetry
 finder.

Depends: root-system

Depends: libroot-tmva-dev, libroot-montecarlo-vmc-dev, libroot-math-mlp-dev
X-Comment: Somebody injected the libraries from the ROOT system explicitely
 here - so these are included since root-system is packaged again
X-Suggests: root-plugin-fftw3, libroot-mathmore5.18
 In case these packages will be created in root-system these need to be
 added here as well.
