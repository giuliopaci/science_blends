Pkg-Description: Engineering simulation framework
 Salomé is a powerful LGPL framework for engineering simulations.  It has
 CAD capability within itself, can import and export CAD files in IGES
 format, can mesh those files, and control an external parallel solver
 such as Code Aster, then visualize the results.  Salomé is at the heart
 of the new CAELinux (Computer-Aided Engineering Linux) live DVD
 distribution.
