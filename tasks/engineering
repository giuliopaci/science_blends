Pkg-Description: Engineering simulation framework
 Salomé is a powerful LGPL framework for engineering simulations.  It has
 CAD capability within itself, can import and export CAD files in IGES
 format, can mesh those files, and control an external parallel solver
 such as Code Aster, then visualize the results.  Salomé is at the heart
 of the new CAELinux (Computer-Aided Engineering Linux) live DVD
 distribution.

Pkg-Description: A Combinatorial/Constructive Solid Geometry, solid modeling system
 BRL-CAD is a powerful Combinatorial/Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG)
 solid modeling system that includes an interactive geometry editor,
 ray-tracing support for rendering and geometric analysis,
 network-distributed framebuffer support, image and signal-processing
 tools, and an embedded scripting language. It has been developed over
 a 20 year period and is now a stable mature product. This is the
 first GPL'ed release of the package. It is being maintained by the
 US Army Research laboratory (ARL).

Pkg-Description: uncertainty treatment and reliability analyses
 OpenTURNS is an Open source initiative to Treat Uncertainties, Risks'N
 Statistics in a structured industrial approach.
 Since the beginning of 2005, a partnership of three companies has been working
 on building together a tool designed to perform uncertainty treatment and
 reliability analyses.
 .
 OpenTURNS is a Unix/Linux software with three main components :
 .
 - a scientific C++ library including an internal data model and algorithms
 dedicated to the treatment of uncertainties. The main function of that library
 is giving to specific applications all the functionalities needed to treat
 uncertainties in studies. Targeted users are all engineers who want to
 introduce the probabilistic dimension in their so far deterministic studies.
 .
 - an independent application with a graphical user interface. This application
 was built to become the work environment for the specialist of the treatment
 of uncertainties. Targeted users are once again industrial practitioners:
 those who identify the treatment of uncertainties as a full task, which can be
 spread to multiple engineering domains.
 .
 - a python module with high level operators in the probabilistic and statistical
 field. The interest of this language is to be both a powerful scientific
 language (capable of using C++ libraries), and a user friendly interpreted
 language like Matlab(tm) one. This python module was designed to make the
 development of prototypes easier (in order to test new algorithms and methods
 for example), to become an easy-to-use support for educational works. This
 module intends to become a natural environment capable of integrating new
 developments within the field of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. The
 targeted users are here research centres and the academic community.

Pkg-Description: Thermal and mechanical finite element simulation software
 Code_Aster (file/package name aster) is a mature finite element code for
 structural and thermal analysis.  Its development has been guided by the
 needs of the nuclear engineering industry, and it enjoys wide use and
 distribution.  It is also a major component of the recently-released
 CAELinux live DVD distribution, and links well with Salomé for
 high-quality pre- and post-processing.

License: GPL
Responsible: Sylvestre Ledru <sylvestre.ledru@inria.fr>
Pkg-URL: http://svn.debian.org/viewsvn/debian-science/packages/ecs/
Pkg-Description: Computational fluid dynamics software
 The basic capabilities of Code_Saturne enable the handling of either
 incompressible or expandable flows with or without heat transfer and
 turbulence. Dedicated modules are available for specific physics such as
 radiative heat transfer, combustion (gas, coal, heavy fuel oil, ...),
 magneto-hydrodynamics, compressible flows, two-phase flows (Euler-Lagrange
 approach with two-way coupling), or atmospheric flows.

Pkg-Description: Analyser for the aerodynamic and flight-dynamic of rigid aircraft.
 AVL is a program for the aerodynamic and
 flight-dynamic analysis of rigid aircraft of arbitrary
 configuration. It employs an extended vortex lattice model for the
 lifting surfaces, together with a slender-body model for fuselages and
 nacelles. General nonlinear flight states can be specified. The flight
 dynamic analysis combines a full linearization of the aerodynamic
 model about any flight state, together with specified mass properties.

Pkg-Description: An extensible CAx program (alpha)
 FreeCAD is a CAx RAD based on OpenCasCade, Qt and Python.
 It features some key concepts like macro recording, workbenches, ability
 to run as a server and dynamically loadable application extensions and
 it is designed to be platform independent.
 .
 Currently, FreeCAD can import and display CAD models in IGES, STEP, and
 BRep formats and meshes in STL, BMS, AST and Wavefront OBJ formats.
 Editing and modeling features are currently somewhat limited.
