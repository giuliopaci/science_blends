Task: Engineering
Description: Debian Science Engineering packages
 This metapackage is part od the Debian Pure Blend "Debian Science"
 and installs packages related to Engineering.
 .
 Please not that there is an additional package engineering-dev
 which depends from packages which are useful to develop engineering
 related software.

Pkg-Description: Engineering simulation framework
 Salomé is a powerful LGPL framework for engineering simulations.  It has
 CAD capability within itself, can import and export CAD files in IGES
 format, can mesh those files, and control an external parallel solver
 such as Code Aster, then visualize the results.  Salomé is at the heart
 of the new CAELinux (Computer-Aided Engineering Linux) live DVD
 distribution.

Depends: brlcad

WNPP: 289632
License: GPL
Responsible: none
Pkg-Description: A Combinatorial/Constructive Solid Geometry, solid modeling system
 BRL-CAD is a powerful Combinatorial/Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG)
 solid modeling system that includes an interactive geometry editor,
 ray-tracing support for rendering and geometric analysis,
 network-distributed framebuffer support, image and signal-processing
 tools, and an embedded scripting language. It has been developed over
 a 20 year period and is now a stable mature product. This is the
 first GPL'ed release of the package. It is being maintained by the
 US Army Research laboratory (ARL).

Depends: openturns

Depends: code-aster

Pkg-URL: http://lyre.mit.edu/~powell/aster/
Pkg-Description: Thermal and mechanical finite element simulation software
 Code_Aster (file/package name aster) is a mature finite element code for
 structural and thermal analysis.  Its development has been guided by the
 needs of the nuclear engineering industry, and it enjoys wide use and
 distribution.  It is also a major component of the recently-released
 CAELinux live DVD distribution, and links well with Salomé for
 high-quality pre- and post-processing.

Pkg-Description: Analyser for the aerodynamic and flight-dynamic of rigid aircraft.
 AVL is a program for the aerodynamic and
 flight-dynamic analysis of rigid aircraft of arbitrary
 configuration. It employs an extended vortex lattice model for the
 lifting surfaces, together with a slender-body model for fuselages and
 nacelles. General nonlinear flight states can be specified. The flight
 dynamic analysis combines a full linearization of the aerodynamic
 model about any flight state, together with specified mass properties.

Depends: hdfview

Depends: pycgns
Homepage: http://elsa.onera.fr/CGNS/releases/
License: GPL-2
Pkg-Description: Package is a Python binding to the CGNS library
The package contains a wrapper on top of the ADF and MLL APIs, some tools,
demos, tests, and examples taken from the CGNS tutorial.
