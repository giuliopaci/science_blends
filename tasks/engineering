Task: Engineering
Description: Debian Science Engineering packages
 This metapackage is part of the Debian Pure Blend "Debian Science"
 and installs packages related to Engineering.
 .
 Please not that there is an additional package engineering-dev
 which depends from packages which are useful to develop engineering
 related software.

Pkg-Description: Analyser for the aerodynamic and flight-dynamic of rigid aircraft.
 AVL is a program for the aerodynamic and
 flight-dynamic analysis of rigid aircraft of arbitrary
 configuration. It employs an extended vortex lattice model for the
 lifting surfaces, together with a slender-body model for fuselages and
 nacelles. General nonlinear flight states can be specified. The flight
 dynamic analysis combines a full linearization of the aerodynamic
 model about any flight state, together with specified mass properties.

Depends: cgns-convert

Depends: pycgns
Homepage: http://elsa.onera.fr/CGNS/releases/
License: GPL-2
Pkg-Description: Package is a Python binding to the CGNS library
 The package contains a wrapper on top of the ADF and MLL APIs, some tools,
 demos, tests, and examples taken from the CGNS tutorial.


X-Removed: Packages removed from Debian

Depends: varkon
Homepage: http://varkon.sourceforge.net
Pkg-URL: http://snapshot.debian.org/package/varkon/
Pkg-Description: A CAD-system with parametric modelling
 VARKON is a high level development tool for applications in the
 area of Engineering, Computer Aided Design and Product Modelling.
 .
 VARKON can be used as a traditional CAD-system with drafting,
 modelling and visualisation if you want to but the real power of
 VARKON is in parametric modelling and CAD applications development.
 VARKON includes interactive parametric modelling in 2D or 3D but also
 the unique MBS programming language integrated in the graphical
 environment.
Remark: Removed from Debian
 This package was removed from Debian but some versions are available
 from http://snapshot.debian.org/
 .
 Reasons are given here: http://bugs.debian.org/596115

Depends: tochnog
Homepage: http://tochnog.sourceforge.net/
Pkg-URL: http://snapshot.debian.org/package/tochnog/
Pkg-Description: A free implicit/explicit finite element analysis program
 Tochnog is a program for finite element analysis.
 Multithreading and multiprocessor systems are supported.
 Here is a partial list of models supported:
  * Differential equations (materials).
  * Convection-diffusion equations,
  * Stokes and Navier-Stokes,
  * Elasticity (isotropy and transverse isotropy),
  * Plasticity (Von-Mises, Mohr-Coulomb, Gurson, etc.;
    plasticity surfaces can be arbitrarily combined).
 .
 Residues in equations and error estimates for all data
 can be printed/plotted.
Remark: Removed from Debian
