Task: Modeling of neural systems
Description: Debian Science packages for modeling of neural systems
 This metapackage will install Debian packages which might be useful for
 scientists interested in modeling of real neural systems at different
 levels (from single neuron to complex networks).
 .
 The selection of packages is targeting the application of simulation
 techniques. Methods developers are referred to the
 science-statistics, science-imageanalysis,
 science-numericalcomputation, med-imaging, and med-imaging-dev
 metapackages for a variety of additional software that might be
 useful for neuroscience research.
