Task: Nanoscale Physics
Description: Debian Science Nanoscale Physics packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages related to
 Nanoscale Physics, which corresponds to the study of physical systems
 typically ranging from 1 to 100 nm in size. The properties of such
 systems usually depend on the number of atoms they are made of, while
 this number is still relatively large for an accurate description.
 .
 The nanoscale is the meeting point of classical and quantum physics.
 Previous research efforts were considering either smaller systems, for
 which everybody could develop their own methods and software
 independently, or much bigger systems, for which it was clearly
 impossible to provide a fine-grained description. Addressing the issues
 raised by the nanoscale requires however cooperative and coordinated
 efforts in a multidisciplinary context. This metapackage is part of
 such an endeavor.
 .
 Please note that packages listed as "recommended" may not be installed 
 by default, and that packages listed as "suggested" will not be
 installed unless the user asks for them to be installed.
 .
 You might also be interested in the debtag field::physics and, depending on
 your focus, in the physics and education-physics metapackages.

Pkg-Description: PAW atomic dataset generator
 The computer program atompaw generates projector and basis functions
 which are needed for performing electronic structure calculations based
 on the Projector-Augmented Wave (PAW) method. The program is applicable
 to materials throughout the periodic table. It produces an output file
 containing the projector and basis functions and the corresponding
 matrix elements in a form which can be read be the PWPAW and ABINIT
 codes. Additional data files are also produced which can be used to
 help evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the generated functions.

Published-DOI: 10.1063/1.2949547
Pkg-Description: Wavelet-based electronic-structure calculations
 BigDFT is a DFT-based massively parallel electronic structure code using
 a wavelet basis set. Wavelets constitute a real space basis set
 distributed on an adaptive mesh (two levels of resolution in our
 implementation).
 .
 Thanks to our Poisson solver based on a Green function formalism,
 periodic systems, surfaces and isolated systems can be simulated with
 the proper boundary conditions. GTH or HGH pseudopotentials are used to
 remove the core electrons.
 .
 The Poisson solver is also integrated in ABINIT, OCTOPUS and CP2K.
