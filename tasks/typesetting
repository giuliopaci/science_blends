 in a paper.

Depends: zotero
Homepage: http://www.zotero.org/
License: BSD
Pkg-Description: reference manager software
 Zotero is an easy-to-use yet powerful research tool that helps you
 gather, organize, and analyze sources (citations, full texts, web
 pages, images, and other objects), and lets you share the results of
 your research in a variety of ways. An extension to the popular
 open-source web browser Firefox, Zotero includes the best parts of
 older reference manager software (like EndNote)—the ability to store
 author, title, and publication fields and to export that information
 as formatted references—and the best parts of modern software and web
 applications (like iTunes and del.icio.us), such as the ability to
 interact, tag, and search in advanced ways. Zotero integrates tightly
 with online resources; it can sense when users are viewing a book,
 article, or other object on the web, and—on many major research and
 library sites—find and automatically save the full reference
 information for the item in the correct fields. Since it lives in the
 web browser, it can effortlessly transmit information to, and receive
 information from, other web services and applications; since it runs
 on one’s personal computer, it can also communicate with software
 running there (such as Microsoft Word). And it can be used offline as
 well (e.g., on a plane, in an archive without WiFi).
