Depends: latexdiff

Pkg-Description: Determine and mark up significant differences between latex files
 This perl script compares two versions of a LaTeX document and generates
 another LaTeX file which, when compiled, has the differences highlighted.
 Although LaTeX sometimes complains a little when compiling the diff file, it
 works reasonably well. It is useful for co-authors to visualize what changed
 in a paper.
