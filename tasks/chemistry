Task: Chemistry
Description: Debian Science Chemistry packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages related to Chemistry.
 You might be interested as well in field::chemistry debtag and, depending on 
 your focus, in education-chemistry metapackage.

Why: To be handled by debichem once they have metapackages (like \
     science-geography / Debian GIS and science-biology / Debian Med)

Pkg-Description: display crystal structures on ordinary computer hardware
 DRAWxtl reads a basic description of the crystal structure, which includes
 unit-cell parameters, space group, atomic coordinates, thermal parameters or
 a Fourier map, and outputs a geometry object that contains polyhedra, planes,
 lone-pair cones, spheres or ellipsoids, bonds, iso-surface Fourier contours
 and the unit-cell boundary.
 .
 Four forms of graphics are produced:
 .
  (1) an openGL window for immediate viewing
  (2) the Persistence of Vision Ray Tracer (POV-RAY) scene language for
      publication-quality drawings
  (3) the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) for dissemination
      across the Internet
  (4) a Postscript rendering of the OpenGL window for those that want
      high-quality output but do not have
      POV-RAY installed.

Pkg-Description: rational protein design library
 The EGAD Library is a modular, object oriented approach to rational protein
 design. It is platform-independent, written in C++ and, most importantly,
 free. Its raison d'etre is to serve as a tool for building protein design
 applications. It can also be used as a test-bed for the comparison of
 different energy functions and minimization algorithms under the same physical
 model.
 .

Pkg-Description: Evaluate the integrals in modern atomic and molecular theory
 Libint library is used to evaluate the traditional (electron repulsion)
 and certain novel two-body matrix elements (integrals) over Cartesian
 Gaussian functions used in modern atomic and molecular theory. The idea
 of the library is to let computer write optimized code for computing
 such integrals. There are two primary advantages to this: much less
 human effort is required to write code for computing new integrals, and
 code can be optimized specifically for a particular computer
 architecture (e.g., vector processor).
 .
 Libint has been utilized to implement methods such as Hartree-Fock (HF)
 and Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS DFT), second-order
 Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), coupled cluster singles and
 doubles (CCSD) method, as well as explicitly correlated R12 methods.
 The following software packages use Libint:

 Improves mpqc (#409025) and psi3.
