Task: High Energy Physics
Description: Debian Science High Energy Physics packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages related to High Energy
 Physics, which is a branch of physics that studies the elementary subatomic
 constituents of matter and radiation, and their interactions.  The field is
 also called Particle Physics.
 .
 You might also be interested in the debtag field::physics and, depending on
 your focus, in the physics and education-physics metapackages.

Pkg-Description: C++ Event Record for Monte Carlo Generators
 The HepMC package is an object oriented event record written in C++
 for High Energy Physics Monte Carlo Generators.
 .
 Many extensions from HEPEVT, the Fortran HEP standard, are
 supported: the number of entries is unlimited, spin density matrices
 can be stored with each vertex, flow patterns (such as color) can be
 stored and traced, integers representing random number generator
 states can be stored, and an arbitrary number of event weights can
 be included. Particles and vertices are kept separate in a graph
 structure, physically similar to a physics event.
 .
 The added information supports the modularisation of event
 generators.  Event information is accessed by means of iterators
 supplied with the package.

Pkg-Description: Les Houches Accord Parton Density Function interface
 LHAPDF provides a unified and easy to use interface to modern PDF
 sets. It is designed to work not only with individual PDF sets but
 also with the more recent multiple "error" sets. It can be viewed as
 the successor to PDFLIB, incorporating many of the older sets found
 in the latter, including pion and photon PDFs. In LHAPDF the
 computer code and input parameters/grids are separated thus allowing
 more easy updating and no limit to the expansion possibilities.

Pkg-Description: Fast C++ code for the kt and other jet algorithms
 The FastJet package provides a fast implementation of several
 longitudinally invariant sequential recombination jet algorithms, in
 particular the longitudinally invariant kt jet algorithm, the
 inclusive longitudinally invariant version of the Cambridge/Aachen
 jet-algorithm, and the inclusive anti-kt algorithm.

Pkg-Description: Events Generator of High Energy Physics
 PYTHIA is a program for the generation of high-energy physics
 events, i.e. for the description of collisions at high energies
 between elementary particles such as e+, e-, p and pbar in various
 combinations. It contains theory and models for a number of physics
 aspects, including hard and soft interactions, parton distributions,
 initial- and final-state parton showers, multiple interactions,
 fragmentation and decay.

Pkg-Description: Robust Independent Validation of Experiment and Theory
 Rivet is a toolkit for validation of Monte Carlo event
 generators. Using a computationally efficient model for observable
 computations, Rivet provides a set of experimental analyses useful
 for generator sanity checks, as well as a convenient infrastructure
 for adding your own analysis.

Pkg-Description: Toolkit for High Energy Physics Event Generation
 ThePEG is a general toolkit for implementing physics models of event
 generation in high energy particle collisions. It defines a general
 structure of event generation in terms of abstract base classes for
 e.g. hard partonic matrix elements, parton showers and the decay of
 unstable particles. Different models are then implemented by
 creating classes which inherits from these base classes and
 implements sets of pre-defined virtual functions.

Pkg-Description: Integral Evaluator of One-loop Feynman Diagram
 LoopTools is a package for evaluation of scalar and tensor one-loop
 integrals based on the FF package by G.J. van Oldenborgh. It
 features an easy Fortran, C++, and Mathematica interface to the
 scalar one-loop functions of FF and in addition provides the 2-, 3-,

Pkg-Description: Multi-purpose event generator for high energy physics
 Herwig++ is a completely new event generator, written in C++. It is
 built on the experience gained with the well-known event generator
 HERWIG. The aim is to provide a multi purpose event generator with
 similar or improved capabilities (like angular ordered parton
 evolution and the cluster hadronization model).

Pkg-Description: toolkit for simulation of particle/nuclear physics in detectors
 GEANT4 is a toolkit for the simulation of the passage of particles through
 matter.   Its application areas include high energy physics and nuclear
 experiments, medical, accelerator and space physics studies.  The GEANT4
 software consists of an extensive set of libraries, fundamentally
 object-oriented and based in modern C++.  It may be used to develop programs
 with command-line, Xaw-based, or Motif-based interfaces.
 .
 This package is a metapackage that depends upon all components of a
 GEANT4 environment.  Unless you know exactly what parts of GEANT4
 you want, it is best to install this package.
