Task: High Energy Physics
Description: Debian Science High Energy Physics packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages related to High Energy
 Physics, which is a branch of physics that studies the elementary subatomic
 constituents of matter and radiation, and their interactions.  The field is
 also called Particle Physics.
 .
 You might also be interested in the debtag field::physics and, depending on
 your focus, in the physics and education-physics metapackages.

Pkg-Description: Robust Independent Validation of Experiment and Theory
 Rivet is a toolkit for validation of Monte Carlo event
 generators. Using a computationally efficient model for observable
 computations, Rivet provides a set of experimental analyses useful
 for generator sanity checks, as well as a convenient infrastructure
 for adding your own analysis.

Pkg-Description: Toolkit for High Energy Physics Event Generation
 ThePEG is a general toolkit for implementing physics models of event
 generation in high energy particle collisions. It defines a general
 structure of event generation in terms of abstract base classes for
 e.g. hard partonic matrix elements, parton showers and the decay of
 unstable particles. Different models are then implemented by
 creating classes which inherits from these base classes and
 implements sets of pre-defined virtual functions.

Pkg-Description: Integral Evaluator of One-loop Feynman Diagram
 LoopTools is a package for evaluation of scalar and tensor one-loop
 integrals based on the FF package by G.J. van Oldenborgh. It
 features an easy Fortran, C++, and Mathematica interface to the
 scalar one-loop functions of FF and in addition provides the 2-, 3-,
 and 4-point tensor coefficient functions.

Pkg-Description: Multi-purpose event generator for high energy physics
 Herwig++ is a completely new event generator, written in C++. It is
 built on the experience gained with the well-known event generator
 HERWIG. The aim is to provide a multi purpose event generator with
 similar or improved capabilities (like angular ordered parton
 evolution and the cluster hadronization model).

Pkg-Description: toolkit for simulation of particle/nuclear physics in detectors
 GEANT4 is a toolkit for the simulation of the passage of particles through
 matter.   Its application areas include high energy physics and nuclear
 experiments, medical, accelerator and space physics studies.  The GEANT4
 software consists of an extensive set of libraries, fundamentally
 object-oriented and based in modern C++.  It may be used to develop programs
 with command-line, Xaw-based, or Motif-based interfaces.
 .
 This package is a metapackage that depends upon all components of a
 GEANT4 environment.  Unless you know exactly what parts of GEANT4
 you want, it is best to install this package.
