Pkg-Description: workload management system
 Like other full-featured batch systems, Condor provides a job queueing
 mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme, resource monitoring, and
 resource management. Users submit their serial or parallel jobs to Condor,
 Condor places them into a queue. It chooses when and where to run the jobs
 based upon a policy, carefully monitors their progress, and ultimately
 informs the user upon completion.
 .
 Unlike more traditional batch queueing system, Condor can also effectively
 harness wasted CPU power from otherwise idle desktop workstations. Condor
 does not require a shared file system across machines - if no shared file
 system is available, Condor can transfer the job's data files on behalf of
 the user.

Pkg-Description: cooperative computing tools
 This is a collection of software that help users to share resources in a
 complex, heterogeneous, and unreliable computing environment. This includes:
 .
  Chirp - A personal filesystem and I/O protocol that allows unprivileged users
          to share space securely, efficiently, and conveniently. When combined
          with Parrot, Chirp allows users to create custom wide-area distributed
          filesystems.
  Parrot - A transparent user-level virtual filesystem that allows any ordinary
          program to be attached to a remote storage device such as an FTP
          server or a Chirp server.
  Makeflow - A workflow system for parallel and distributed computing that uses
          a language very similar to Make.
  Work Queue - A system and API for building master-worker style programs that
          scale up to thousands of processors.
  All Pairs - A computational abstraction for running very large Cartesian
          products.
  Wavefront - A computational asbtraction for running very large dynamic
          programming problems.
  The Fault Tolerant Shell - A high-level programming language that allows
          users to combine the ease of shell scripting, the power of distributed
          programming, and the precision of compiled languages. Basically,
          parallel programming and exception handling for scripts.

Pkg-Description: bindings of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard
 MPI for Python (mpi4py) provides bindings of the Message Passing
 Interface (MPI) standard for the Python programming language,
 allowing any Python program to exploit multiple processors.
 .
 mpi4py is constructed on top of the MPI-1/MPI-2 specification
 and provides an object oriented interface which closely follows MPI-2
 C++ bindings.  It supports point-to-point (sends, receives) and
 collective (broadcasts, scatters, gathers) communications of any
 picklable Python object as well as optimized communications of Python
 object exposing the single-segment buffer interface (NumPy arrays,
 builtin bytes/string/array objects).
