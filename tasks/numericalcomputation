Task: Numerical Computation
Description: Debian Science Numerical Computation packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages useful for
 numerical computation. The packages provide an array oriented
 calculation and visualisation system for scientific computing and
 data analysis. These packages are similar to commercial systems such
 as Matlab and IDL.


Depends: octave | octave3.0 | octave3.1
Why: numerical programming environment similar to Matlab

Suggests: octaviz
Why: 3D visualisaion system for Octave

Depends: python-matplotlib, python-scipy, ipython, python-numpy
Why: Python based numerical programming environment similar to Matlab

Depends: pdl
Why: Perl based numerical programming environment similar to Matlab

Depends: gnudatalanguage
Why: numerical programming environment compatible with IDL

Depends: scilab

Depends: freemat

Depends: yorick

Depends: r-base
Why: S is the statistician's Matlab and R is to S what Octave is to Matlab.

Pkg-Description:  A Gtk+ IDE for GNU Octave
 The OctaveDE is a development environment for the Octave mathematical
 software package. Octave normally is run in a terminal. Octavede
 provides an GTK/X11 application that provides functionality similar to
 other mathematical software packages. It offers quick access to files
 and workspace variables, as well as a simple integrated editor.
