Task: Numerical Computation
Description: Debian Science Numerical Computation packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages useful for
 numerical computation. The packages provide an array oriented
 calculation and visualisation system for scientific computing and
 data analysis. These packages are similar to commercial systems such
 as Matlab and IDL.


Depends: octave | octave3.0 | octave3.2
Why: numerical programming environment similar to Matlab

Suggests: octaviz
Why: 3D visualisaion system for Octave

Depends: python-matplotlib, python-scipy, ipython, python-numpy, spyder, python-guiqwt
Why: Python based numerical programming environment similar to Matlab

Depends: pdl
Why: Perl based numerical programming environment similar to Matlab

Depends: gnudatalanguage
Why: numerical programming environment compatible with IDL

Depends: scilab, scilab-sivp, scilab-scimax, scilab-swt, scilab-ann, 
 scilab-plotlib

Depends: freemat

Depends: yorick

Depends: r-base
Why: S is the statistician's Matlab and R is to S what Octave is to Matlab.

Depends: octavede

Depends: lush
Why: environment for prototyping large numeric computations in Lisp

Depends: yade
Why: platform for discrete element modeling

Depends: liggghts
Why: open source discrete element method particle simulation code

Depends: esys-particle
Why: Open Source software for particle-based numerical modelling. The software implements the Discrete Element Method (DEM).

Suggests: hpcc
