Pkg-Description: Software library for collision detection of geometric objects in 3D space.
 Collision detection is the process of detecting pairs of objects that
 are intersecting or are within a given proximity of each other. SOLID
 contains operations for performing intersection tests and proximity
 queries on a wide variety of shape types, including: deformable triangle
 meshes, boxes, ellipsoids, and convex polyhedra.
 .
 Since it exploits temporal coherence in a number of ways, SOLID is
 especially useful for detecting collisions between objects that move
 smoothly over time. The motions of objects are controlled by the client
 application, and are not determined or affected by SOLID.
 .
 Although it can be used for physics-based simulations, SOLID is not a
 physics engine by itself. SOLID leaves it up to the application
 programmer how the laws of physics are implemented.

 The Kinematics and Dynamics Library (KDL) develops an
 application independent framework for modelling and computation of kinematic
 chains, such as robots, biomechanical human models, computer-animated
 figures, machine tools, etc. It provides class libraries for geometrical
 objects (point, frame, line,... ), kinematic chains of various families
 (serial, humanoid, parallel, mobile,... ), and their motion specification and
 interpolation.

Pkg-Description: framework for inference in Dynamic Bayesian Networks
 The Bayesian Filtering Library (BFL) provides an application
 independent framework for inference in Dynamic Bayesian Networks, i.e.,
 recursive information processing and estimation algorithms based on Bayes'
 rule, such as (Extended) Kalman Filters, Particle Filters (or Sequential
 Monte Carlo methods), etc. These algorithms can, for example, be run on top
 of the Realtime Services, or be used for estimation in Kinematics & Dynamics
 applications.

 planning. OpenRAVE's stand-alone nature allows is to be easily
 integrated into existing robotics systems.
 .
 It provides many command line tools to work with robots and planners,
 and the run-time core is small enough to be used inside controllers
 and bigger frameworks. An important target application is industrial
