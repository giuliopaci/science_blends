Pkg-Description: hard real-time network protocol stack
 RTnet is an Open Soure hard real-time network protocol stack 
 for Xenomai and RTAI (real-time Linux extensions). It makes use of standard 
 Ethernet hardware and supports several popular NIC chip sets, including 
 Gigabit Ethernet. Moreover, Ethernet-over-1394 support is available based on 
 the RT-FireWire protocol stack.

Pkg-Description: developing component-based robotic systems
 Orca is an open-source framework for developing 
 component-based robotic systems. It provides the means for defining and 
 developing the building-blocks which can be pieced together to form 
 arbitrarily complex robotic systems, from single vehicles to distributed 
 sensor networks.

Pkg-Description: synthesis, and simulation of robotic manipulator models
 ROBOOP is a C++ robotics object oriented programming toolbox 
 suitable for synthesis, and simulation of robotic manipulator models in an 
 environment that provides ``MATLAB like'' features for the treatment of 
 matrices. Its is a portable tool that does not require the use of commercial 
 software.

Pkg-Description: Orocos Real-Time Toolkit
 The Orocos Real-Time Toolkit (RTT) is not an application
 in itself, but it provides the infrastructure and the
 functionalities to build robotics applications in C++. The
 emphasis is on real-time, online interactive and
 component based applications.

Pkg-Description: Kinematics and Dynamics Library
 The Kinematics and Dynamics Library (KDL) develops an 
 application independent framework for modelling and computation of kinematic 
 chains, such as robots, biomechanical human models, computer-animated 
 figures, machine tools, etc. It provides class libraries for geometrical 
 objects (point, frame, line,... ), kinematic chains of various families 
 (serial, humanoid, parallel, mobile,... ), and their motion specification and 
 interpolation.

Pkg-Description: Orocos Component Library
 The Orocos Component Library uses the Real-Time Toolkit (RTT) 
 for constructing all its components. Some components use the Kinematics and 
 Dynamics Library (KDL), the Bayesian Filtering Library (BFL) or other 
 libraries.

Pkg-Description: framework for inference in Dynamic Bayesian Networks
 The Bayesian Filtering Library (BFL) provides an application 
 independent framework for inference in Dynamic Bayesian Networks, i.e., 
 recursive information processing and estimation algorithms based on Bayes' 
 rule, such as (Extended) Kalman Filters, Particle Filters (or Sequential 
 Monte Carlo methods), etc. These algorithms can, for example, be run on top 
 of the Realtime Services, or be used for estimation in Kinematics & Dynamics 
 applications.
