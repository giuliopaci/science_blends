Pkg-Description: hard real-time network protocol stack
 RTnet is an Open Soure hard real-time network protocol stack
 for Xenomai and RTAI (real-time Linux extensions). It makes use of standard
 Ethernet hardware and supports several popular NIC chip sets, including
 Gigabit Ethernet. Moreover, Ethernet-over-1394 support is available based on
 the RT-FireWire protocol stack.

Pkg-Description: developing component-based robotic systems
 Orca is an open-source framework for developing
 component-based robotic systems. It provides the means for defining and
 developing the building-blocks which can be pieced together to form
 arbitrarily complex robotic systems, from single vehicles to distributed
 sensor networks.

Pkg-Description: synthesis, and simulation of robotic manipulator models
 ROBOOP is a C++ robotics object oriented programming toolbox
 suitable for synthesis, and simulation of robotic manipulator models in an
 environment that provides ``MATLAB like'' features for the treatment of
 matrices. Its is a portable tool that does not require the use of commercial
 software.

Pkg-Description: Orocos Real-Time Toolkit
 The Orocos Real-Time Toolkit (RTT) is not an application
 in itself, but it provides the infrastructure and the
 functionalities to build robotics applications in C++. The
 emphasis is on real-time, online interactive and
 component based applications.

Pkg-Description: Kinematics and Dynamics Library
 The Kinematics and Dynamics Library (KDL) develops an
 application independent framework for modelling and computation of kinematic
 chains, such as robots, biomechanical human models, computer-animated
 figures, machine tools, etc. It provides class libraries for geometrical
 objects (point, frame, line,... ), kinematic chains of various families
 (serial, humanoid, parallel, mobile,... ), and their motion specification and
 interpolation.

Pkg-Description: Orocos Component Library
 The Orocos Component Library uses the Real-Time Toolkit (RTT)
 for constructing all its components. Some components use the Kinematics and
 Dynamics Library (KDL), the Bayesian Filtering Library (BFL) or other
 libraries.

Pkg-Description: framework for inference in Dynamic Bayesian Networks
 The Bayesian Filtering Library (BFL) provides an application
 independent framework for inference in Dynamic Bayesian Networks, i.e.,
 recursive information processing and estimation algorithms based on Bayes'
 rule, such as (Extended) Kalman Filters, Particle Filters (or Sequential
 Monte Carlo methods), etc. These algorithms can, for example, be run on top
 of the Realtime Services, or be used for estimation in Kinematics & Dynamics
 applications.
