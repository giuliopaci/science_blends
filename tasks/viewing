 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages related to data
 visualization. You might also be interested in the use::viewing
 debtag.

Depends: pdl, gnudatalanguage

Depends: kst
Why: displaying scientific data

Depends: ifrit

Depends: yorick

Depends: python-scientific
Why: Maybe should go in some other metapackage (mathematics?)

Suggests: findimagedupes, libpuzzle-bin
Why: Those two packages are not necessarily needed for scientific work but a hint for
     their existence might be very reasonable.

Pkg-Description: VTK/Java based 3D Scientific Data Viewer
 Cassandra is a open source scientific data viewer based on VTK. Cassandra
 provides a dynamic interaction with the VTK pipeline and enables to load
 plugins dynamically in order to perform specific tasks in data manipulation
 and visualisation.
 .
 Cassandra is developed by Artenum in the frame of its internal Research and
 Development program and illustrates its skills in scientific visualisation
 and VTK technology. Cassandra has already been used for many applications in
 scientific computing and space environment analysis.

Pkg-Description: TeX package to draw normal and/or logarithmic plots directly in TeX
 This package provides tools to generate plots and labeled axes
 easily. It draws normal plots, logplots and semi-logplots. Axis
 ticks, labels, legends (in case of multiple plots) can be added
 with key-value options. It can cycle through a set of predefined
 line/marker/color specifications. In summary, its purpose is to
 simplify the generation of high-quality function plots,
 especially for use in scientific contexts (logplots).
