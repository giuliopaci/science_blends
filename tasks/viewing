Pkg-Description: Parallel Visualization Application
 ParaView is an open-source, multi-platform application designed to
 visualize data sets of size varying from small to very large. The
 goals of the ParaView project include the following:
 .
     * Develop an open-source, multi-platform visualization application.
     * Support distributed computation models to process large data sets.
     * Create an open, flexible, and intuitive user interface.
     * Develop an extensible architecture based on open standards.
 .
 ParaView runs on distributed and shared memory parallel as well as
 single processor systems and has been successfully tested on Windows,
 Mac OS X, Linux and various Unix workstations, clusters and
 supercomputers. Under the hood, ParaView uses the Visualization
 Toolkit as the data processing and rendering engine and has a user
 interface written using Qt.

Pkg-Description: Tools to process and visualize scientific data and images
 Teem is a coordinated group of libraries for representing, processing, 
 and visualizing scientific raster data. Teem includes command-line tools 
 that permit the library functions to be quickly applied to files and 
 streams, without having to write any code. The most important and useful 
 libraries in Teem are:
 .
  * Nrrd (and the unu command-line tool on top of it) supports a range of
    operations for transforming N-dimensional raster data (resample, crop,
    slice, project, histogram, etc.), as well as the NRRD file format for
    storing arrays and their meta-information.
  * Gage: fast convolution-based measurements at arbitrary point locations
    in volume datasets (scalar, vector, tensor, etc.)
  * Mite: a multi-threaded ray-casting volume render with transfer functions
    based on any quantity Gage can measure
  * Ten: for estimating, processing, and visualizing diffusion tensor fields,
    including fiber tractography methods.
