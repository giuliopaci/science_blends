Pkg-Description: Tools to process and visualize scientific data and images
 Teem is a coordinated group of libraries for representing, processing, 
 and visualizing scientific raster data. Teem includes command-line tools 
 that permit the library functions to be quickly applied to files and 
 streams, without having to write any code. The most important and useful 
 libraries in Teem are:
 .
  * Nrrd (and the unu command-line tool on top of it) supports a range of
    operations for transforming N-dimensional raster data (resample, crop,
    slice, project, histogram, etc.), as well as the NRRD file format for
    storing arrays and their meta-information.
  * Gage: fast convolution-based measurements at arbitrary point locations
    in volume datasets (scalar, vector, tensor, etc.)
  * Mite: a multi-threaded ray-casting volume render with transfer functions
    based on any quantity Gage can measure
  * Ten: for estimating, processing, and visualizing diffusion tensor fields,
    including fiber tractography methods.
