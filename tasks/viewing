 visualization. You might also be interested in the use::viewing
 debtag.

Depends: vistrails

Why: IDL-like

Depends: kst
Why: displaying scientific data

Depends: ifrit

Depends: yorick

Depends: python-scientific
Why: Maybe should go in some other metapackage (mathematics?)

Depends: fityk

Depends: gnuplot, grace, gri, labplot, graphviz, pyxplot, plotdrop, qtiplot

Depends: python-guiqwt
Why: collection of widgets based on QWT5 for data visualisation.

Depends: g3data

Depends: grits
Pkg-Description: Grits is a Virtual Globe library
 Grits is a "Virtual Globe" library which uses OpenGL to render an image of
 the earth using satellite and terrain data from publicly accessible servers.
 This is similar in concept to Google Earth and NASA World Wind, except
 implemented as a library.

Language: R
Pkg-Description: Another Plot PACKage for GNU R
 The package offers a set of functions for drawing special plots.
 This comprises stem.leaf which plots a stem and leaf plot, the bagplot 
 to plot a 2D variant of boxplots, faces plots chernoff faces,
 spin3R supports the inspection of a 3D point cloud and there are
 slider functions for interactive graphics.

Suggests: findimagedupes, libpuzzle-bin
Why: Those two packages are not necessarily needed for scientific work but a hint for
     their existence might be very reasonable.

Depends: cassandra
Homepage: http://dev.artenum.com/projects/cassandra
License: QPL
Pkg-Description: VTK/Java based 3D Scientific Data Viewer
 Cassandra is a open source scientific data viewer based on VTK. Cassandra
 provides a dynamic interaction with the VTK pipeline and enables to load
 plugins dynamically in order to perform specific tasks in data manipulation
 and visualisation.
 .
 Cassandra is developed by Artenum in the frame of its internal Research and
 Development program and illustrates its skills in scientific visualisation
 and VTK technology. Cassandra has already been used for many applications in
 scientific computing and space environment analysis.

Responsible: OHURA Makoto <ohura@debian.org>
Pkg-Description: TeX package to draw normal and/or logarithmic plots directly in TeX
 This package provides tools to generate plots and labeled axes
 easily. It draws normal plots, logplots and semi-logplots. Axis
 ticks, labels, legends (in case of multiple plots) can be added
 with key-value options. It can cycle through a set of predefined
 line/marker/color specifications. In summary, its purpose is to
 simplify the generation of high-quality function plots,
 especially for use in scientific contexts (logplots).

Suggests: circos
