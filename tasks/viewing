Task: Viewing
Description: Debian Science data visualisation packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages related to data
 visualization.
 You might be interested as well in use::viewing debtag.

Depends: pdl, gnudatalanguage
Why: IDL-like

Depends: kst
Why: displaying scientific data

Depends: ifrit

Depends: yorick

Depends: python-scientific
Why: Maybe should go in some other metapackage (mathematics?)

Depends: fityk

Depends: gnuplot, grace, gri, labplot, graphviz, pyxplot

Depends: imview

Depends: mayavi

Depends: g3data

Depends: med-imaging

Depends: gwyddion

Depends: paraview

Suggests: pgplot5
Why: non-free

Suggests: findimagedupes, libpuzzle
Why: Those two packages are not necessarily needed for scientific work but a hint for
     their existence might be very reasonable.

Suggests: libgtkdatabox | libgtkdatabox-0.8.2-2 | libgtkdatabox-0.9.0-0
Comment: We have to find a way to make sure that version number changes in the
         library will be regarded effectively in the metapackages.

Pkg-Description: Tools to process and visualize scientific data and images
 Teem is a coordinated group of libraries for representing, processing, 
 and visualizing scientific raster data. Teem includes command-line tools 
 that permit the library functions to be quickly applied to files and 
 streams, without having to write any code. The most important and useful 
 libraries in Teem are:
 .
  * Nrrd (and the unu command-line tool on top of it) supports a range of
    operations for transforming N-dimensional raster data (resample, crop,
    slice, project, histogram, etc.), as well as the NRRD file format for
    storing arrays and their meta-information.
  * Gage: fast convolution-based measurements at arbitrary point locations
    in volume datasets (scalar, vector, tensor, etc.)
  * Mite: a multi-threaded ray-casting volume render with transfer functions
    based on any quantity Gage can measure
  * Ten: for estimating, processing, and visualizing diffusion tensor fields,
    including fiber tractography methods.
