Pkg-Description: Sampling-based motion planning library development files
 Consists of a set of sampling-based motion planning
 algorithms. The content of the library is limited to these algorithms,
 which means there is no environment specification, no collision 
 detection or visualization. The library is designed so it can be easily
 integrated into systems that provide the additional needed components.
