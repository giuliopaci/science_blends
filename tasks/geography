Description: Debian Science Geography packages

 Geography.  You might also be interested in the field::geography
 debtag and, depending on your focus, in the education-geography
 metapackage.

Depends: gis-workstation
Why: handled by Debian GIS. The Depends: will be replaced by an other special \
     tag (its name to be decided).

X-Pkg-Description: Geographic Information System (GIS)
 A Geographic Information System (GIS) manages, analyzes, and displays
 databases of geographic information. Quantum GIS (QGIS) supports shapefile
 viewing and editing, spatial data storage with PostgreSQL/PostGIS, projection
 on-the-fly, map composition, and a number of other features via a plugin
 interface. QGIS also supports display of various georeferenced raster and
 Digital Elevation Model (DEM) formats including GeoTIFF, Arc/Info ASCII Grid,
 and USGS ASCII DEM.
X-Comment: This project used to be an official Debian in Etch but vanished later
 from the Debian pool of packaged software because it had a lot of
 bugs. The reaons are given here: http://bugs.debian.org/474604. Perhaps
 later upstream version might qualify for inclusion again. The URL of the
 "unofficial" package points to the location of the package in Etch.

Comment:  kflog was removed from Debian in Lenny and is not really a good candidate
 for Debian Science so it makes no sense to add it as prospective package here.
