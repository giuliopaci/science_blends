Task: Data acquisition
Description: Debian Science data acquisition packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages related to data
 acquisition.  This might be used in several sciences (as for instance
 science-viewing and science-typesetting).

Pkg-Description: TANGO is an object oriented distributed control system using CORBA
 TANGO is an object oriented distributed control system using CORBA.
 .
 In TANGO all objects are representations of devices.  The devices can
 be on the same computer or distributed over a number of computers
 interconnected by a network. Communication inter devices is done using
 CORBA and can be synchronous, asynchronous or event driven.
 .
 The object model in TANGO supports methods, attributes and properties.
 TANGO provides an API which hides all the details of network access and
 provides object browsing, discovery and security features.
 .
 Permanent data is stored in a Mysql database.
 .
 TANGO is being actively developed as a collaborative effort between the
 ESRF (www.esrf.eu), Soleil (synchrotron-soleil.fr), Alba (www.cells.es)
 and Elettra institutes (www.elettra.trieste.it).

Responsible: Carlo Segre <segre@debian.org>
Pkg-Description: data acquisition and control system
 MX is a data acquisition and control system that is designed to serve
 several functions:
  * As a portable toolkit for writing data acquisition and control
    programs.
  * As a standalone system capable of controlling entire experiments.
  * As a platform for building device control servers to be used by
    other applications.
  * As a way of extending other control systems and of glueing disparate
    control systems together.
