Task: Data acquisition
Description: Debian Science data acquisition packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages related to data
 acquisition.  This might be used in several sciences (as for instance
 science-viewing and science-typesetting).

Pkg-Description: Stock Linux kernel with RT-Preempt patch
 The RT-Preempt (http://rt.wiki.kernel.org) project provides patches
 to make Linux kernel capable of fulfilling hard realtime
 requirements. The aim is to eliminate all preemptivity and reactivity
 problems in the kernel over the time by adding deterministic
 preemption points.  The -rt patches are constantly being worked on
 for mainline by the community.
 .
 Pengutronix's Realtime Linux for Debian project provides builds of
 the stock Linux kernel with the RT-Preempt patch (but without Debian
 patches).
Remark: The upstream kernel sources are not considered DFSG-free, so
 the packages are available from the non-free area only.

Pkg-Description: data acquisition and control system
 MX is a data acquisition and control system that is designed to serve
 several functions:
  * As a portable toolkit for writing data acquisition and control
    programs.
  * As a standalone system capable of controlling entire experiments.
  * As a platform for building device control servers to be used by
    other applications.
  * As a way of extending other control systems and of glueing disparate
    control systems together.
