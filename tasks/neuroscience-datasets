Task: Neuroscience Datasets
Description: Debian Science packages for Neuroscience Datasets
 This metapackage will install Debian packages that provide neuroscientific
 datasets. These datasets can be useful as common data files for applications
 (e.g. stereotaxic atlases), as example data for online tutorials or teaching,
 and as input data for analysis algorithms in demonstrations or test suites.

Pkg-Description: MNI stereotaxic space human brain template
 This is an unbiased standard magnetic resonance imaging template volume for
 the normal human population. It has been created by the Montreal Neurological
 Institute (MNI) using anatomical data from the International Consortium for
 Brain Mapping (ICBM).
 .
 The package provides a 1x1x1 mm and 0.5x0.5x0.5 mm resolution templates
 (hemissphere-symetric and asymetric non-linearily co-registered versions),
 some including T1w, T2w, PDw modalities, T2 relaxometry, and tissue probability
 maps. In addition, it contains a lobe atlas, and masks for brain, eyes and
 face.

Pkg-Description: Talairach stereotaxic space template
 This template MRI volume was created from 27 T1-weighted MRI scans of a
 single individual that have been transformed into the Talairach stereotaxic
 space. The anatomical image is complemented by a brain and a head mask.
 All images are in 1x1x1 mm resolution.
 .
 This package provides the template in NIfTI format.

Pkg-Description: MRI-based brain atlas of the rhesus macaque monkey
 A population-average MRI-based atlas collection for the rhesus macaque (Macaca
 mulatta) that can be used with common brain mapping packages such as SPM or
 FSL. In addition to T1-weighted atlas data, probabilistic tissue classification
 maps and T2-weighted atlases were also created. Theses atlases are aligned to
 the MRI volume from the Saleem, K.S. and Logothetis, N.K. (2006) atlas
 providing an explicit link to histological sections. Additionally, there is
 a transform to integrate these atlases with the F99 surface-based atlas in
 CARET.

Pkg-Description: MRI-based brain atlas of normal adult human brain anatomy
 SRI24 is an MRI-based atlas of normal adult human brain anatomy,
 generated by template-free nonrigid registration from images of 24
 normal control subjects.
 .
 The atlas comprises T1, T2, and PD weighted structural MRI, tissue
 probability maps (GM, WM, CSF), maximum-likelihood tissue
 segmentation, DTI-based measures (FA, MD, longitudinal and
 transversal diffusivity), and two labels maps of cortical regions and
 subcortical structures. The atlas is provided at 1mm isotropic image
 resolution in NIfTI format.
