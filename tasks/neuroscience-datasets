Description: Debian Science packages for Neuroscience Datasets
 This metapackage will install Debian packages that provide neuroscientific
 datasets. These datasets can be useful as common data files for applications
 (e.g. stereotaxic atlases), as example data for online tutorials or teaching,
 and as input data for analysis algorithms in demonstrations or test suites.

Pkg-Description: MNI stereotaxic space human brain template
 This is an unbiased standard magnetic resonance imaging template volume for
 the normal human population. It has been created by the Montreal Neurological
 Institute (MNI) using anatomical data from the International Consortium for
 Brain Mapping (ICBM).
 .
 The package provides a 1x1x1 mm and 0.5x0.5x0.5 mm resolution templates
 (hemissphere-symetric and asymetric non-linearily co-registered versions),
 some including T1w, T2w, PDw modalities, T2 relaxometry, and tissue probability
 maps. In addition, it contains a lobe atlas, and masks for brain, eyes and
 face.
