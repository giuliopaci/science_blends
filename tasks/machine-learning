Why: Statistical models
Description: classes and functions for the estimation of statistical models
 scikits.statsmodels is a pure Python package that provides classes
 and functions for the estimation of several categories of statistical
 models. These currently include linear regression models, OLS, GLS,
 WLS and GLS with AR(p) errors, generalized linear models for six
 distribution families and M-estimators for robust linear models. An
 extensive list of result statistics are available for each estimation
 problem.

Pkg-Description: Library for Large Linear Classification
 LIBLINEAR  is a linear classifier for data with millions of instances and 
 features. It supports
 .
  * L2-regularized classifiers
    L2-loss linear SVM, L1-loss linear SVM, and logistic regression (LR)
  * L1-regularized classifiers (after version 1.4)
    L2-loss linear SVM and logistic regression (LR)
 .
 Main features of LIBLINEAR include
 .
   * Same data format as LIBSVM
   * similar usage to LIBSVM
   * Multi-class classification: 1) one-vs-the rest, 2) Crammer & Singer
   * Cross validation for model selection
   * Probability estimates (logistic regression only)
   * Weights for unbalanced data
   * MATLAB/Octave interface

Pkg-Description: OCAS solver for training linear SVM classifiers
 This library implements Optimized Cutting Plane Algorithm (OCAS) for training
 linear SVM classifiers from large-scale data. The computational effort of OCAS
 scales with O(m log m) where m is the sample size. In an extensive empirical
 evaluation OCAS significantly outperforms current state of the art SVM solvers,
 like SVM^light, SVM^perf and BMRM, achieving speedups of over 1,000 on some
 datasets over SVM^light and 20 over SVM^perf, while obtaining the same precise
 Support Vector solution.
 .
  * SVM solvers for training linear classifiers from large scale-data
  * Binary (two-class) and genuine multi-class SVM formulations
  * Optimized code written in C
  * Reads examples from SVM^light format
  * Optimized for both sparse and dense features
  * Parallelized version of the binary solver
  * binary solver)
  * Tools for classification
  * Training translation invariant image classifiers from virtual examples
  * Functions for computing image features based on Local Binary Patterns
  * (LBP)

Pkg-Description: Complete genetic algorithm framework written in pure python
 Pyevolve was developed to be a complete genetic algorithm framework written in
 pure python. The main objectives of Pyevolve are:
 .
  * written in pure python  - to maximize the cross-platform aspect
  * easy to use API         - the API must be easy to the end-user
  * see the evolution       - the user can and must see and interact with the
                              evolution statistics, graphs, etc.
  * extensible              - the API must be extensible, the user can create
                              new representations, genetic operators such as
                              crossover, mutation, etc.
  * fast                    - the design must be optimized for performance
  * common features         - the framework must implement the most common
                              features: selectors like roulette wheel,
                              tournament, ranking, uniform. Scaling schemes
                              such as linear scaling, etc.
  * default parameters      - we must have default operators, settings, etc
                              in all options

Pkg-Description: Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors
 FLANN is a library for performing fast approximate nearest neighbor searches
 in high dimensional spaces. It contains a collection of algorithms we found
 to work best for nearest neighbor search and a system for automatically
 choosing the best algorithm and optimum parameters depending on the dataset.

Pkg-Description: A matlab-like environment for state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.
 Torch5 provides a Matlab-like environment for state-of-the-art machine
 learning algorithms. It is easy to use and provides a very efficient
 implementation, thanks to an easy and fast scripting language (Lua) and
 a underlying C implementation.

Depends: lush
Why: LUSH is a generic Lisp environment for numeric computation, but
 because ML is of primary interest of the authors, thus lush contains
 quite a few ML libraries (ANN, SVM, etc).

 within the context of computer vision
