Why: Statistical models
Pkg-Description: classes and functions for the estimation of statistical models
 scikits.statsmodels is a pure Python package that provides classes
 and functions for the estimation of several categories of statistical
 models. These currently include linear regression models, OLS, GLS,
 WLS and GLS with AR(p) errors, generalized linear models for six
 distribution families and M-estimators for robust linear models. An
 extensive list of result statistics are available for each estimation
 problem.

Pkg-Description: Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors
 FLANN is a library for performing fast approximate nearest neighbor searches
 in high dimensional spaces. It contains a collection of algorithms we found
 to work best for nearest neighbor search and a system for automatically
 choosing the best algorithm and optimum parameters depending on the dataset.

Pkg-Description: A matlab-like environment for state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.
 Torch5 provides a Matlab-like environment for state-of-the-art machine
 learning algorithms. It is easy to use and provides a very efficient
 implementation, thanks to an easy and fast scripting language (Lua) and
 a underlying C implementation.
