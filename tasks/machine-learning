Task: Machine Learning
Description: Debian Science Machine Learning packages
 This metapackage will install Debian packages which might be useful for
 scientists interested in machine learning.  Included packages range
 from knowledge-based (expert) inference systems to software
 implementing dominant nowadays statistical methods.

Depends: python-pyke, gprolog, yap
Comments: Prolog (and alike) systems for inductive reasoning

Depends: libtorch3-dev

Depends: libshogun-dev, libfann-dev, libsvm-dev, libcomplearn-dev
Comment: above libraries have also variety of interfaces to high-level
 scripting languages (e.g. Python) and even possibly some interactive GUI

Depends: python-scikits-learn, python-mdp, python-mlpy
Comment: Native Python toolkits

Depends: weka

Why: Statistical models
Description: classes and functions for the estimation of statistical models
 scikits.statsmodels is a pure Python package that provides classes
 and functions for the estimation of several categories of statistical
 models. These currently include linear regression models, OLS, GLS,
 WLS and GLS with AR(p) errors, generalized linear models for six
 distribution families and M-estimators for robust linear models. An
 extensive list of result statistics are available for each estimation
 problem.
