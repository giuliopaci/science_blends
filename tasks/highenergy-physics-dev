Task: High Energy Physics (devel)
Description: Debian Science High Energy Physics development packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages related to development
 of High Energy Physics applications, which is a branch of physics that studies
 the elementary subatomic constituents of matter and radiation, and their
 interactions.  The field is also called Particle Physics.
 .
 You might also be interested in the debtag field::physics and, depending on
 your focus, in the physics and education-physics metapackages.
