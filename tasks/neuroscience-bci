Task: Brain-computer interface
Description: Debian Science packages for the design and use of
 brain-computer interface (BCI) -- direct communication pathway
 between a brain and an external device. BCIs are often aimed
 at assisting, augmenting or repairing human cognitive or
 sensory-motor functions.
 .

 The selection of packages is targeting the complete frameworks for
 the design of BCI systems.  Often such systems rely on external
 presentation, data collection and analysis software which could be
 found in science-neuroscience-cognitive, science-dataacquisition,
 data-machine-learning metapackages.
