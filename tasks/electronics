Task: Electronics
Description: Debian Science Electronics packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages related to
 Electronics.  You might also be interested in the field::electronics
 debtag and, depending on your focus, in the education-electronics
 metapackage.

Depends: avrdude, gcc-avr, gerbv, qucs, uisp

Pkg-Description: Verilog preprocessor
 VBPP is a Verilog preprocessor. It has support for most Verilog
 preprocessing directives and additional directives such as:
 .
  * Statement generator ('generate' command in VHDL).
  * Expression evaluation.
  * Mathematical functions: log2, ceil, floor, round, abs, etc.
  * Conditionals: if, switch, etc.

Pkg-Description: Verilog Behavioral Simulation
 Verilog is a Hardware Description Language used mostly for digital
 circuit design and simulation. This program is a simple
 implementation of a Verilog simulator. VBS tries to implement all of
 the Verilog behavioral constructs that are synthesizable, but still
 allow complex test vectors for simulation.

Depends: ksimus
Pkg-URL: http://snapshot.debian.org/package/ksimus/
Homepage: http://ksimus.berlios.de
Pkg-Description: KDE tool for simulating electrical circuits
 KSimus is an application for simulating networks with boolean and floating
 point data type. Some more data types are planned. Currently there exists
 only a few components, but because of the modular character of KSimus
 extensions are easy to develop.
