Task: Electronics
Description: Debian Science Electronics packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages related to
 Electronics.  You might also be interested in the field::electronics
 debtag and, depending on your focus, in the education-electronics
 metapackage.

Pkg-Description: complete set of CAD programs for design of VLSI circuits
 Herb is a complete set of CAD programs and libraries for the specification,
 design and validation of VLSI circuits. It includes a VHDL simulator, logic
 synthesis tools, automatic place and route tools, layout editors, portable
 CMOS standard cell libraries and custom block generators for creating custom
 high performance circuits.
 .
 Herb supports the following file formats:
  * Behavioural: VHDL, VHDL FSM (input-only)
  * Netlists: Alliance, SPICE, EDIF 2.0, VHDL, COMPASS, HILO (output-only) and
    Verilog (output-only)
  * Symbolic layout: Alliance, COMPASS
  * Physical layout: CIF (output-only) and GDSII (output-only)

Pkg-Description: Verilog code coverage analysis tool
 Covered is a Verilog code coverage utility that reads in a Verilog design and
 a generated VCD/LXT dumpfile from that design and generates a coverage file
 that can be merged with other coverage files or used to create a coverage
 report. Covered also contains the GUI coverage report utility that reads in a
 coverage file to allow interactive coverage discovery. Areas of coverage
 measured by Covered are: line, toggle, memory, combinational logic, FSM
 state/state-transition and assertion coverage.
