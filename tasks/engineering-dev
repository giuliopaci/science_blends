Pkg-Description: Java interface to NetCDF files
 The NetCDF-Java library implements a Common Data Model (CDM), a generalization
 of the NetCDF, OpenDAP and HDF5 data models. The library is a prototype for the
 NetCDF-4 project, which provides a C language API for the "data access layer"
 of the CDM, on top of the HDF5 file format. The NetCDF-Java library is a 100%
 Java framework for reading netCDF and other file formats into the CDM, as well
 as writing to the netCDF-3 file format. The NetCDF-Java library also implements
 NcML, which allows you to add metadata to CDM datasets, as well as to create
 virtual datasets through aggregation.
