Task: Economics
Description: Debian Science Economics packages
 This metapackage will install Debian Science packages useful for economics and
 econometrics. It includes user-friendly programs for simulating and estimating
 macro-economic and micro-economic models. It also provides computing
 environments which can solve a wide range of problems typically encountered in
 economic research. These environments provide functionalities similar to those
 of popular non-free systems (such as MATLAB, Mathematica, Stata or SAS).

Pkg-Description: Economic modelling in Python
 Dolo is a tool to assist researchers in solving several types of Dynamic
 Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models, using either local of global
 approximation methods.
 .
 Users are can separate the definition of their models from the solution
 algorithm. A simple syntax is provided in YAML files to define variables and
 equations of several types. This syntax integrates the specification of
 occasionally binding constraints (a.k.a. complementarity conditions)
 .
 The user can then implement his own preferred solution method using one of the
 provided tools (various types of interpolation, solvers, ...) or use one of
 the already implemented procedures.
 .
 Dolo is written in Python and so are his solution routines. If you prefer or
 need to use another language for the solution, you can always use dolo as a
 preprocessor. In that case, dolo will just translate the model file into a
 numerical file usable by your software. Currently, Octave/MATLAB and Julia are
 supported.
