Pkg-Description: NCAR Command Language and NCAR Graphics package
 The NCAR Command Language (NCL) is a free interpreted language designed
 specifically for scientific data processing and visualization. NCL has robust
 file input and output. It can read and write netCDF-3, netCDF-4 classic (as
 of version 4.3.1), HDF4, binary, and ASCII data, and read HDF-EOS2, GRIB1 and
 GRIB2 (as of version 4.3.0). The graphics are world class and highly
 customizable.
