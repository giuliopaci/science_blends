Pkg-Description: Executables for the magics++ library
 Magics++ is the latest generation of the ECMWF's Meteorological plotting
 software MAGICS. Although completely redesigned in C++, it is intended to be
 as backwards-compatible as possible with the Fortran interface.
 Besides its programming interfaces (Fortran and C), Magics++ offers MagML,
 a plot description language based on XML aimed at automatic web production.
 .
 This package contains the MagcML binary that may be used with magics++.

Pkg-Description: Grid Analysis and Display System for earth science data
 The Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS) is an interactive desktop tool that is used for easy access, manipulation, and visualization of earth 
 science data. The format of the data may be either binary, GRIB, NetCDF, or HDF-SDS (Scientific Data Sets). GrADS has been implemented worldwide on a 
 variety of commonly used operating systems and is freely distributed over the Internet.
Why: Used as default tool for viewing BUFR files.

Pkg-Description: NCAR Command Language and NCAR Graphics package
 The NCAR Command Language (NCL) is a free interpreted language designed
 specifically for scientific data processing and visualization. NCL has robust
 file input and output. It can read and write netCDF-3, netCDF-4 classic (as
 of version 4.3.1), HDF4, binary, and ASCII data, and read HDF-EOS2, GRIB1 and
 GRIB2 (as of version 4.3.0). The graphics are world class and highly
 customizable.
