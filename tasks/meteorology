Pkg-Description: Database for punctual meteorological data (Command line tools)
 DB-All.e is a fast on-disk database where meteorological observed and
 forecast data can be stored, searched, retrieved and updated.
 .
 This framework allows to manage large amounts of data using its simple
 Application Program Interface, and provides tools to visualise, import
 and export in the standard formats BUFR, AOF and CREX.

Pkg-Description: Weather data visualization: GRIB file viewer
 This package is a program,  written with the QT toolki, to enable:
  * Visualisation of meteo data from files in GRIB Format 1
  * Automatic GRIB data download
  * Automatic Download from IAC (fleetcode) Data

Depends: libemos0d
Why: Library used by many programs for BUFR and GRIB file manipulation.

Pkg-Description: ECMWF Interpolation Library
 The Interpolation library (EMOSLIB) includes Interpolation software and GRIB,
 BUFR, CREX encoding/decoding routines. It is used by the ECMWF meteorological
 archival and retrieval system (MARS) and also by the ECMWF graphics
 package MetView.

Depends: libgrib-api-tools
Responsible: Enrico Zini <enrico@debian.org>
Homepage: http://www.ecmwf.int/products/data/software/grib_api.html
Pkg-Description: GRIB decoding/encoding software (utilities)
 The ECMWF GRIB API is an application program interface accessible from C and
 FORTRAN programs developed for encoding and decoding WMO FM-92 GRIB edition 1
 and edition 2 messages.
 .
 This is a useful set of command line tools to give quick access to grib
 messages.
 .
 ECMWF is the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.

Depends: magics++
Homepage: http://www.ecmwf.int/products/data/software/msgics++.html
Responsible: Alastair McKinstry <mckinstry@debian.org>
Pkg-Description: Executables for the magics++ library
 Magics++ is the latest generation of the ECMWF's Meteorological plotting
 software MAGICS. Although completely redesigned in C++, it is intended to be
 as backwards-compatible as possible with the Fortran interface.
 Besides its programming interfaces (Fortran and C), Magics++ offers MagML,
 a plot description language based on XML aimed at automatic web production.
 .
 This package contains the MagcML binary that may be used with magics++.
