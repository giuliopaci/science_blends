Pkg-Description: Weather data visualization: GRIB file viewer
 This package is a program,  written with the QT toolki, to enable:
  * Visualisation of meteo data from files in GRIB Format 1
  * Automatic GRIB data download
  * Automatic Download from IAC (fleetcode) Data

Depends: libemos0d
Why: Library used by many programs for BUFR and GRIB file manipulation.

Remark: Metapackages should not depend from libraries but rather
 from tools using these libraries.  If the metapackage is a -dev
 package targeting at development it should depend from the
 library development package.

Responsible: Alastair McKinstry <mckinstry@debian.org>
Pkg-Description: Executables for the magics++ library
 Magics++ is the latest generation of the ECMWF's Meteorological plotting
 software MAGICS. Although completely redesigned in C++, it is intended to be
 as backwards-compatible as possible with the Fortran interface.
 Besides its programming interfaces (Fortran and C), Magics++ offers MagML,
 a plot description language based on XML aimed at automatic web production.
 .
 This package contains the MagcML binary that may be used with magics++.
