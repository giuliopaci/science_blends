Task: Psychophysics
Description: Debian Science packages for Psychophysics
 This metapackage will install Debian packages which might be useful for
 carrying out any experiment relating physical stimuli and their
 psychological effects.
 .
 The selection of packages is targeting software for stimuli delivery.
 For additional software related to the analysis of the acquired data
 refer to science-neuroscience-cognitive, med-imaging depending on the
 domain of application.  Additionally look into
 science-neuroscience-bci since those often provide a complete loop
 frameworks including stimuli delivery.
