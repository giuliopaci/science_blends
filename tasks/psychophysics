Task: Psychophysics
Description: Debian Science packages for Psychophysics
 This metapackage will install Debian packages which might be useful for
 carrying out any experiment relating physical stimuli and their
 psychological effects.
 .
 The selection of packages is targeting software for stimuli delivery.
 For additional software related to the analysis of the acquired data
 refer to science-neuroscience-cognitive, med-imaging depending on the
 domain of application.  Additionally look into
 science-bci since those often provide a complete loop
 frameworks including stimuli delivery.

Pkg-Description: De Bruijn cycle generator
 Continuous carry-over, fMRI experiments present stimuli in a counter-balanced
 sequence, meaning every stimulus precedes and follows every other. Higher
 level counterbalancing is useful to guard against some modeling assumptions
 of the approach and to test for the effects of stimulus history and context.
 Sequences that efficiently provide this control of stimulus order are called
 de Bruijn cycles.
 .
 This package provides a commandline tool to generate de Bruijn cycles.

Pkg-Description: neurological stimulation, data acquisition and experiment control
 Nrec , developed by Friedemann Bunjes and Jan Gukelberger at the
 Neurology of Tübingen University, is a package for stimulation, data
 acquisition and experiment control in the flavour of cognitive fMRI
 research, which has been expanded to include flexible biosignal
 acquisition and sensory stimulation. It produces Matlab-readable files
 and generally puts an emphasis on standards like using the comedi Linux
 data acquisition library, OpenGL, XML parameter file format and hdf5
 data storage files format.
