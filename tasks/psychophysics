Task: Psychophysics
Description: Debian Science packages for Psychophysics
 This metapackage will install Debian packages which might be useful for
 carrying out any experiment relating physical stimuli and their
 psychological effects.
 .
 The selection of packages is targeting software for stimuli delivery.
 For additional software related to the analysis of the acquired data
 refer to science-neuroscience-cognitive, med-imaging depending on the
 domain of application.  Additionally look into
 science-bci since those often provide a complete loop
 frameworks including stimuli delivery.

Pkg-Description: toolbox for vision research -- Octave bindings
 Psychophysics Toolbox Version 3 (PTB-3) is a free set of Matlab and
 GNU/Octave functions for vision research. It makes it easy to
 synthesize and show accurately controlled visual and auditory stimuli
 and interact with the observer.
 .
 The Psychophysics Toolbox interfaces between Matlab or Octave and the
 computer hardware. The Psychtoolbox's core routines provide access to
 the display frame buffer and color lookup table, allow
 synchronization with the vertical retrace, support millisecond
 timing, allow access to OpenGL commands, and facilitate the
 collection of observer responses. Ancillary routines support common
 needs like color space transformations and the QUEST threshold
 seeking algorithm.
 .
 This package contains bindings for Octave.
