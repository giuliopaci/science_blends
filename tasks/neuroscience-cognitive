Task: Cognitive Neuroscience
Description: Debian Science packages for Cognitive Neuroscience
 This metapackage will install Debian packages which might be useful for
 scientists doing cognitive neuroscience research. This comprises the full
 research process from conducting psychophysical experiments, over data
 acquisition and analysis, to visualization and typesetting of scientific
 results.
 .
 The selection of packages is targeting the application of analysis
 techniques. Methods developers are referred to the science-statistics,
 science-imageanalysis, science-numericalcomputation, med-imaging, and
 med-imaging-dev metapackages for a variety of additional software that
 might be useful in the context of cognitive neuroscience.

Pkg-Description: image processing factory for MR images
 BrainVISA is a software, which embodies an image processing
 factory. A simple control panel allows the user to trigger some
 sequences of treatments on series of images. These treatments are
 performed by calls to command lines provided by different
 laboratories. These command lines, hence, are the building blocks on
 which are built the assembly lines of the factory. BrainVISA is
 distributed with a toolbox of building blocks dedicated to the
 segmentation of T1-weighted MR images. The product of the main
 assembly line made up from this toolbox is the following: grey/white
 classification for Voxel Based Morphometry, Meshes of each hemisphere
 surface for visualization purpose, Spherical meshes of each
 hemisphere white matter surface, a graph of the cortical folds, a
 labeling of the cortical folds according to a nomenclature of the
 main sulci.

Homepage: http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl
Language: Matlab/Octave
WNPP: 605492
License: GPL-2+
Pkg-Description: toolbox for MEG and EEG analysis
 The software includes algorithms for simple and advanced analysis of MEG and
 EEG data, such as time-frequency analysis, source reconstruction using dipoles,
 distributed sources and beamformers and non-parametric statistical testing. It
 supports the data formats of all major MEG systems (CTF, Neuromag, BTi) and of
 the most popular EEG systems, and new formats can be added easily. FieldTrip
 contains high-level functions that you can use to construct your own analysis
 protocols in Matlab. Furthermore, it easily allows developers to incorporate
 low-level algorithms for new EEG/MEG analysis methods.
Remark: The NIMH distributes a "port" of fieldtrip to Octave (at
 http://kurage.nimh.nih.gov/meglab/Meg/Software). It needs to be figured out
 whether this port can be incorporated into the official version, and to what
 degree it is complete. Packaging fieldtrip is required to complete the
 packaging of SPM8.
