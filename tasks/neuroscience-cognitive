Task: Cognitive Neuroscience
Description: Debian Science packages for Cognitive Neuroscience
 This metapackage will install Debian packages which might be useful for
 scientists doing cognitive neuroscience research. This comprises the full
 research process from conducting psychophysical experiments, over data
 acquisition and analysis, to visualization and typesetting of scientific
 results.
 .
 The selection of packages is targeting the application of analysis
 techniques. Methods developers are referred to the science-statistics,
 science-imageanalysis, science-numericalcomputation, med-imaging, and
 med-imaging-dev metapackages for a variety of additional software that
 might be useful in the context of cognitive neuroscience.

Pkg-Description: image processing factory for MR images
 BrainVISA is a software, which embodies an image processing
 factory. A simple control panel allows the user to trigger some
 sequences of treatments on series of images. These treatments are
 performed by calls to command lines provided by different
 laboratories. These command lines, hence, are the building blocks on
 which are built the assembly lines of the factory. BrainVISA is
 distributed with a toolbox of building blocks dedicated to the
 segmentation of T1-weighted MR images. The product of the main
 assembly line made up from this toolbox is the following: grey/white
 classification for Voxel Based Morphometry, Meshes of each hemisphere
 surface for visualization purpose, Spherical meshes of each
 hemisphere white matter surface, a graph of the cortical folds, a
 labeling of the cortical folds according to a nomenclature of the
 main sulci.
